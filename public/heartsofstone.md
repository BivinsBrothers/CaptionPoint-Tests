*Deep Feeling* - Chuck Berry
---
## MADISON:
Hello and welcome! 
---
## MADISON:
My name is Madison McAllister and I'm the Assistant Director for *Hearts of Stone*,
---
## MADISON:
a co-production of Arts at the Palace and Women’s Theatre Festival. 
---
## MADISON:
If you can hear me, great-- your audio is working!
---
## MADISON:
If, however, you are reading the captions and there is no sound,
---
## MADISON:
click the megaphone icon in the bottom left corner,
---
## MADISON:
or check that your sound is on in your computer settings.
---
## MADISON:
Now, let's go over some tips to help with your viewing experience: 
---
## MADISON:
To enter full screen mode, 
---
## MADISON:
click on the expand icon in the bottom right hand corner of the video screen. 
---
## MADISON:
You can press the escape key to exit full screen if you are viewing on a computer. 
---
## MADISON:
On mobile devices, click the expand icon again or rotate your device. 
---
## MADISON:
You can also enter theatre mode by clicking the next icon to the left of expand. 
---
## MADISON:
This is a great way to view as well! 
---
## MADISON:
We encourage you to engage through chat on the right, 
---
## MADISON:
but you can click the collapse/expand icon 
---
## MADISON:
in the top left of the chat window depending on your preferences. 
---
## MADISON:
If your experience starts to buffer, we've all been there-
---
## MADISON:
simply click the pause button in the bottom left corner once
---
## MADISON:
to stop the stream and again to restart. 
---
## MADISON:
You can also try reloading the page. 
---
## MADISON:
This is a NEW type of live performance coming to you from multiple locations, 
---
## MADISON:
and we know that many things such as your wifi, the weather, 
---
## MADISON:
and other acts of God are beyond any of our control. 
---
## MADISON:
So give yourself some grace, remember to breathe if your screen freezes, 
---
## MADISON:
and get ready to experience the additional quirks
---
## MADISON:
that now exist as part of the magic of live theatre.
---
## MADISON:
While *Hearts of Stone* is written as a play
---
## MADISON:
to be performed for a live in-person audience,
---
## MADISON:
we’re excited for you to partake in this virtual experiment with us also LIVE.
---
## MADISON:
This is a work in development;
---
## MADISON:
our actors and creative team crafted an adventure 
---
## MADISON:
over the course of only six rehearsals!
---
## MADISON:
Our intention in this experiment is to bring to you the story, characters, 
---
## MADISON:
and questions of Donna Hoke's beautiful and haunting play. 
---
## MADISON:
We have come to love these people and this world and we hope you do too!
---
## MADISON:
The performance runs about 90 minutes without an intermission. 
---
## MADISON:
We welcome you to join us for a brief talkback
---
## MADISON:
with the playwright and team following the show.  
---
## MADISON:
Please, lean in, and join us in the mystery of Donna Hoke's *Hearts of Stone*.

## DOOMSDAY:
I gotta get outta here. I gotta get outta here.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I said, I gotta get out of here.
---
## LIZLEY:
What now?
---
## DEGAULLE:
Scissors.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Larry buried another body.
---
## LIZLEY:
That’s his job.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I’m dying.
---
## LIZLEY:
So am I.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Larry can’t get holda me.
---
## LIZLEY:
You’re not dying, Doom. Not today.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
The pain is getting worse! 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
There are chickens in my gut pecking at my insides!
---
## DEGAULLE:
Body snatchers.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Hatched from the eggs we ate.
---
## LIZLEY:
When they lay some new ones, I’ll take mine scrambled.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I’m in pain, you butchbrain!
---
## LIZLEY:
Butchbrain?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Pain!
---
## DEGAULLE:
Rock.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Dummy believes me.
---
## LIZLEY:
She doesn’t know what the hell you’re saying.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
She can feel my despair without words.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Rock.
---
## LIZLEY:
Then maybe she’ll get you out of here.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Rock!
---
## LIZLEY:
For Christ’s sake, Degaulle, she knows you threw a rock! 
---
## LIZLEY:
She’s gonna throw paper.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Rock.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
She might throw scissors. And she can’t get us out of here.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
‘Cause she’s dumb as a tombstone.
---
## LIZLEY:
You say that while she patiently comforts you day after day?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
She doesn’t understand, and a dying man can say whatever he wants, *LEZ*ley.
---
## LIZLEY:
Fuck off.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Lizley.
---
## LIZLEY:
You heard the man.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Okay, Lizley. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
But c’mon, between Tweedle Dum Dum and Tweedle Dee-Mented, 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
we’re surrounded by dodos.
---
## LIZLEY:
Yes. I am.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
But you’re just dyke nuts, which don’t affect your smarts. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Y’always got a book, and I know you figured a way into the kitchen after hours.
---
## LIZLEY:
How do you know that?
---
## DEGAULLE:
Doughnuts.
---
## LIZLEY:
Geezus. Does everybody know?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
You’re looking pretty porky, P-P-Petunia. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Nobody gains weight on the regular slop.
---
## LIZLEY:
Flattery will get you everywhere, Doom. Geez.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Can you get anything else, Liz? 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
There are pills all over this place. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I always wanted to be a drug addict before I die.
---
## LIZLEY:
You’re not dying!
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Because what would it matter? 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I could just blitz out, blotto outta my mind, and who cares? 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I’m dying anyway.
---
## LIZLEY:
I’m not getting you pills.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
But I’m dy--
---
## LIZLEY:
We’re all dying. That’s no reason to kill yourself.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Lose myself some is all, until the end.
---
## LIZLEY:
I can’t get pills.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Then ya gotta get me outta here, ya gotta get me outta here,
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Ya gotta get me outta here because 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
AAAAAH!
---
## DOOMSDAY:
The chickens!
---
## LIZLEY:
Stop it! Look what you’re doing to her!
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Aaah!
---
## LIZLEY:
Stop it right now! There are no damn chickens!
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Peck peck. On my intestines! Aaaah!!
---
## DEGAULLE:
Body snatchers. Body snatchers. Body snatchers.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I can’t die in here! I can’t! 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Nobody will remember me if I die in here.
---
## LIZLEY:
Nobody’s dying!
---
## DEGAULLE:
Body snatchers.
---
## LIZLEY:
I’m the one who needs out. Geez.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Heard a guard talking ‘bout you.
---
## LIZLEY:
Yeah, what’d he say?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Just that he-- 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Even a girl like you isn’t safe.
---
## LIZLEY:
You’re making that up. You’ll say anything.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I wouldn’t, Liz.
---
## LIZLEY:
We can’t really get outta here.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
We never tried. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
But you got smarts enough to make a plan.
---
## LIZLEY:
A plan to just waltz out of here.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Foxtrot.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Yes--aaaah!
---
## LIZLEY:
We wouldn’t make it five minutes.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Can’t get a bite if you never throw a line.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Scissors.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Scissors! Scissors!

## ROY:
Lydia? Who you talking to?
---
## LYDIA:
There was-- 
---
## LYDIA:
In the room. She looked at me.
---
## ROY:
Who?
---
## LYDIA:
A woman.
---
## ROY:
Go back to sleep.
---
## LYDIA:
She was trying to tell me something.
---
## ROY:
Go back to sleep.
---
## LYDIA:
There were others... a man...
---
## ROY:
Honey, it was a dream.
---
## LYDIA:
She was here.
---
## ROY:
It can seem like that sometimes.
---
## LYDIA:
Yeah, but--
---
## ROY:
Go back to sleep.
---
## LYDIA:
Scissors.
---
---
## ROY:
I hate decaf.
---
## LYDIA:
I can’t taste the difference.
---
## ROY:
That’s what I hate. I’m fooling myself.
---
## LYDIA:
Taking care of yourself.
---
## ROY:
You don’t have to drink it.
---
## LYDIA:
Making two pots is silly.
---
## ROY:
We could get a Keurig.
---
## LYDIA:
Too expensive. 
---
## LYDIA:
And if you have to suffer, I can too.
---
## ROY:
No caffeine and you were still up all night.
---
## LYDIA:
No.
---
## ROY:
I felt you tossing.
---
## LYDIA:
I got up to pee.
---
## ROY:
You have pills.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t like them.
---
## ROY:
I don’t like taking my little lifesavers either,
---
## ROY:
but if you need them...
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t. Need them.
---
## ROY:
If you’re not sleeping, I think you do need--
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t want them.
---
## ROY:
If I don’t get to say that, you don’t either.
---
## LYDIA:
Not the same. 
---
## LYDIA:
My heart won’t stop if I don’t take them.
---
## ROY:
Gaping like that?
---
## ROY:
Bad example for your students.
---
## LYDIA:
They do it all the time. 
---
## LYDIA:
How can they find history boring?
---
## ROY:
These kids aren’t the kids you started out with. 
---
## ROY:
A lot’s changed.
---
## LYDIA:
History doesn’t change.
---
## ROY:
But the times have. 
---
## ROY:
You gotta meet ‘em halfway.
---
## LYDIA:
Meaning I’m closed-minded, or just old?
---
## ROY:
Meaning when are you gonna get a smart phone?
---
## LYDIA:
When are you going to get rid of that ratty robe?
---
## ROY:
I love this robe.
---
## LYDIA:
Someday, it’s going to go missing.
---
## ROY:
Over my dead body. 
---
## ROY:
Maybe not even then. 
---
## ROY:
You could get one of those store dummies, 
---
## ROY:
and put the robe on it, and display it in the living room.
---
## ROY:
With a little sign that has my name on it, and an inscription, 
---
## ROY:
like “Roy died before his robe did.”
---
## LYDIA:
A shrine.
---
## ROY:
I love this robe.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t want a smart phone. 
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t even like the smart board in my class. 
---
## LYDIA:
Or using the school site for grades and assignments. 
---
## LYDIA:
Or the Internet to make sure the kids aren’t plagiarizing. 
---
## LYDIA:
I had to respond to the Teachers’ Wall ceremony--
---
## LYDIA:
when they give the award to a teacher who has been there only ten years--
---
## ROY:
Ten years, I know
---
## LYDIA:
Ten years! With an...
---
## LYDIA:
an e-vite.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t want to be one of those people. 
---
## LYDIA:
There are so many other ways to communicate.
---
## ROY:
Those don’t ever go away.
---
## LYDIA:
I dreamed about them again.
---
## ROY:
That’s what, third time?
---
## LYDIA:
Fourth.
---
## ROY:
And how’s Doomsday doing?
---
## LYDIA:
He’s your favorite.
---
## ROY:
I love his name.
---
## LYDIA:
He’s still dying. 
---
## LYDIA:
Lizley’s still not listening, Dummy’s still not talking, 
---
## LYDIA:
and DeGaulle’s still Rock-Paper-Scissoring as if his life depends on it.
---
## ROY:
On a game of chance?
---
## LYDIA:
It’s not. 
---
## LYDIA:
It’s like...intuitive.
---
## ROY:
It’s chance.
---
## ROY:
What am I going to shoot?
---
## LYDIA:
Paper.
---
## ROY:
So where does it fit into your recurring nightmare?
---
## LYDIA:
Not a nightmare, just... weird. 
---
## LYDIA:
No people I know in it, nothing I can connect to my day... 
---
## LYDIA:
Just-- I tried to find that dream book we had. 
---
## LYDIA:
Did we get rid of it?
---
## ROY:
Honey, Google it.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t even know what to look up. 
---
## LYDIA:
They’re in a hospital I think.
---
## ROY:
My hospital?
---
## LYDIA:
No, like a... permanent-- 
---
## LYDIA:
Like they live there. 
---
## LYDIA:
There’s a picture of Eisenhower on the wall.
---
## ROY:
“A dream about a hospital may be an indication that you or someone close to you..."
---
## ROY:
"needs to heal a physical, mental or spiritual issue..."
---
## ROY:
"or that healing may already be taking place.”
---
## ROY:
Grief might be a spiritual issue.
---
## LYDIA:
But not a spiritual crisis.
---
## ROY:
It doesn’t say crisis. It just says--
---
## LYDIA:
Parents die. We expect that.
---
## ROY:
We expect it, but not unexpectedly.
---
## LYDIA:
No, but even after a long bout with cancer, we’re never really prepared.
---
## ROY:
Suicide isn’t cancer.
---
## LYDIA:
The result is the same. And feeling sad is normal.
---
## ROY:
And angry?
---
## LYDIA:
I’m not angry.
---
## ROY:
Well, I am. 
---
## ROY:
She gave you no warning. 
---
## ROY:
That’s crazy, Lydia; who does that? 
---
## ROY:
She wasn’t thinking about you at all, and look what it’s doing to you.
---
## LYDIA:
I’m fine.
---
## ROY:
Except you’re not sleeping. 
---
## ROY:
You act like your mother had a heart attack or--
---
## LYDIA:
You said it: my spirit is getting old. That’s--
---
## ROY:
I didn’t say--
---
## LYDIA:
That’s my only spiritual issue.
---
## ROY:
Just burnt out. Take a sabbatical.
---
## LYDIA:
So next year--
---
## ROY:
You haven’t had any time to process—
---
## LYDIA:
David Cosgrove will have another reason not to nominate me for the Teachers’ Wall?
---
## ROY:
Or maybe you find something that inspires you so much, he’ll have to.
---
## LYDIA:
I wouldn’t know what to do with myself all day.
---
## ROY:
Explore! Find something to--
---
## LYDIA:
Distract me?
---
## ROY:
Excite you.
---
## ROY:
Do I need to be jealous of these dream people?
---
## LYDIA:
Of DeGaulle?
---
## ROY:
Sure, intense. 
---
## ROY:
A man of few words.
---
## LYDIA:
You’re in the clear. 
---
## LYDIA:
But maybe next dream, I’ll see if they want to go bowling.
---
## ROY:
Do you want to go bowling? 
---
## ROY:
You haven’t been out since--
---
## LYDIA:
Lizley’d kick my ass.
---
## ROY:
Maybe you should write about ‘em. 
---
## ROY:
It’s been years since--
---
## LYDIA:
That was a silly phase.
---
## ROY:
It’s probably like riding a bike.
---
## LYDIA:
Probably?
---
## ROY:
Educated guess from a guy who only reads manuals. 
---
## ROY:
And only when he has to.
---
## ROY:
I gotta get dressed.
---
## LYDIA:
I’m right behind you.
---
## ROY:
Shake up your students today, honey. 
---
## ROY:
Just to see what it feels like.

*School Days* - Chuck Berry
---
## LYDIA:
...DeGaulle was injured again in 1916, 
---
## LYDIA:
and this time, he was captured and put in a German POW camp, 
---
## LYDIA:
where he spent nearly three years, until the end of the war.
---
## LYDIA:
Which drove him crazy. 
---
## LYDIA:
He wanted nothing more than to get back in action, and he tried to escape five times. 
---
## LYDIA:
Was that a yawn, Mr. Armstrong?
---
## ARMSTRONG:
Sorry, Ms. Stokes.
---
## LYDIA:
But even though he spent long periods in solitary confinement 
---
## LYDIA:
and they took away his newspaper--yes, his newspaper. 
---
## LYDIA:
And his cigarettes, he still wrote a book and--
---
## LYDIA:
Ms. Alvarez, that’s not your phone in your hand, is it? 
---
## LYDIA:
Perhaps a visit to the principal’s office--
---
## LYDIA:
You think this is boring.
---
## LYDIA:
Why?
---
## ALVAREZ:
What does it have to do with now?
---
## LYDIA:
What if it was now?
---
## LYDIA:
How do you think the war might been different 
---
## LYDIA:
if we had the technology we have today?
---
## ARMSTRONG:
DeGaulle could have a Facebook page. For his platoon.
---
## ALVAREZ:
Facebook. Really?
---
## ALVAREZ:
Then everyone would know what he was planning.
---
## ARMSTRONG:
A secret Facebook page.
---
## ALVAREZ:
Mark Zuckerberg would know.
---
## ALVAREZ:
And any D-list hacker.
---
## ARMSTRONG:
A website then. 
---
## ARMSTRONG:
Oh Snapchat! 
---
## ARMSTRONG:
Send out an order, and then poof! Gone.
---
## ALVAREZ:
You’re batshit if you think anything is ever really gone.
---
## LYDIA:
Ms. Alvarez, your lang--
---
## ARMSTRONG:
Cellphone codes.
---
## ALVAREZ:
Too easy. 
---
## ALVAREZ:
It would have to be on the dark web--
---
## LYDIA:
The dark web?
---
## ALVAREZ:
The part most people never see.
---
## LYDIA:
Like a chat room or--
---
## ALVAREZ:
Like the rest of the iceberg. 
---
## ALVAREZ:
Most of the web is a whole other world going on.
---
## LYDIA:
An invisible world.
---
## ALVAREZ:
Unless you go looking, someone lets you in.
---
## ARMSTRONG:
DeGaulle would be all over the dark web.
---
## LYDIA:
It’s fun, isn’t it, to think about how people from then might find the world now?
---
## LYDIA:
Or just to think about them as complete people, 
---
## LYDIA:
who they were beyond a few snippets in a history book. 
---
## LYDIA:
I used to love it when my mother would tell me stories about her childhood. 
---
## LYDIA:
Her parents died when she was a baby, and she was raised by my aunt and uncle, 
---
## LYDIA:
and they raised homing pigeons and chickens, 
---
## LYDIA:
and she had this tomboy cousin who teased her because she was afraid of them. 
---
## LYDIA:
Sometimes those stories, from another time, can--
---
## LYDIA:
--can resonate with us, 
---
## LYDIA:
or inspire us to think about what we’ll leave behind. 
---
## LYDIA:
One of the reasons I find history so interesting 
---
## LYDIA:
is because it excites me to know that--
---
## ARMSTRONG:
Is there a bug on you Ms. Stokes?
---
## LYDIA:
--that, um, somebody might have existed years ago who, 
---
## LYDIA:
who likes the things I like, someone I might, um, 
---
## LYDIA:
emulate or...
---
## LYDIA:
...love even. 
---
## LYDIA:
Do you think you might have liked DeGaulle?
---
## ALVAREZ:
He’s kinda hardcore.

Yes, I just thought, um...

No, no...

## ARMSTRONG:
You don’t like it?

That’s cool; you can keep going ‘til you get one that shows what you want to see.

## ARMSTRONG:
How you want to show yourself.

## LIZLEY:
Larry’s digging again.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Prolly for me.
---
## LIZLEY:
He doesn’t dig without a body.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
How’s he do that? Dig such perfect corners?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Even when he was diggin’ morning’ to night after the TB.
---
## LIZLEY:
Focus. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Because he’d rather be outside than crammed in a shoe shop with a bunch of sweaty men.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Nah, it’s ‘cause they give’im his own house.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Special privileges for somebody who minds the ghosts.
---
## LIZLEY:
They’re not ghosts, just dead people. Geez.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Either way, he sure likes their company.
---
## LIZLEY:
I heard they pay him, too, couple dollars each. 
---
## LIZLEY:
I’ve even seen him eating in the kitchen after hours--
---
## DOOMSDAY:
While you’re stealin’ doughnuts?
---
## LIZLEY:
Nobody else wants the job.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
He does it real nice. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
But once he puts you in that hole, you’re erased. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Nobody knows who you are.
---
## LIZLEY:
I know who you are.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
But someday, you’re gonna be a number right next to me.
---
## LIZLEY:
You should be so lucky.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Forever.

## LYDIA:
DeGaulle?

## COSGROVE:
It’s David Cosgrove, Lydia.
---
## LYDIA:
David.
What happened?
---
## COSGROVE:
According to Matthew Armstrong, 
---
## COSGROVE:
you took one look at yourself in the camera and passed out.
---
## LYDIA:
No, there was just--
---
## LYDIA:
I saw something--
---
## COSGROVE:
Something like what?
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t know. I had a headache.
---
## COSGROVE:
Like a migraine? Visual disturbance?
---
## LYDIA:
Maybe.
---
## COSGROVE:
Do you feel okay now?
---
## LYDIA:
I think so. I just--
---
## COSGROVE:
Go home, Lydia. 
---
## COSGROVE:
See a doctor and let’s make sure this isn’t something serious.
---
## LYDIA:
Paper covers rock.
---
## COSGROVE:
Excuse me?
---
## LYDIA:
Paper covers rock.
---
## LYDIA:
Rock pounds scissors. 
---
## LYDIA:
And scissors cuts-- 
---
## LYDIA:
Oh!
---
## COSGROVE:
Lydia? You’re not making sense. 
---
## COSGROVE:
I’m going to call--
---
## LYDIA:
Its okay, David. 
---
## LYDIA:
I’m sure it was just a one-time thing. 
---
## LYDIA:
If I don’t come to school tomorrow, 
---
## LYDIA:
the students will start making up all sorts of stories.
---
## COSGROVE:
They’d worry. You’re a legend here.
---
## LYDIA:
A legend implies somebody whose time is done. 
---
## LYDIA:
Or at least someone who’s left some kind of legacy.
---
## COSGROVE:
Poor choice of words.
---
## LYDIA:
Perhaps.
---
## COSGROVE:
Lydia...
---
## COSGROVE:
I have no voice in the vote for the Teachers Wall.
---
## LYDIA:
I know.
---
## COSGROVE:
I really don’t. 
---
## COSGROVE:
That goes all the way up to the board--
---
## LYDIA:
Did you submit my name this year, David?
---
## COSGROVE:
Lydia--
---
## LYDIA:
Right. I have to get to the library.
---
## COSGROVE:
Are you sure you’re okay?
---
## LYDIA:
Yes, I’ll get Alvarez to help me.

## LYDIA:
Making tea. Don’t make jokes like that.

Didn’t you hear the whistle?

What, no I--

Or that smell? We need air.

## ROY:
What the hell, Lydia?

## LYDIA:
I had a headache--

Another minute there would have been flames!

My mother’s teacup.

## ROY:
The teapot is burned--

## LYDIA:
It’s the last one of the set.
---
## ROY:
Lydia--
---
## ROY:
Maybe we should just put it in the china cabinet.
---
## LYDIA:
No.
---
## LYDIA:
I did it, Roy.

## ROY:
I’m gonna have to sand down that cabinet, and refinish--

## LYDIA:
I mean something unexpected. At school.

## ROY:
And paint the wall--

## LYDIA:
I passed out.

## ROY:
In class? 
---
## ROY:
What? Are you okay?

## LYDIA:
I’m fine. I just... I don’t know. 
---
## LYDIA:
Felt lightheaded and passed out while we were taking selfies.
---
## ROY:
You were taking selfies?
---
## LYDIA:
I was trying something new.
---
## ROY:
Did you call the doctor? 
---
## ROY:
I’m calling the doctor.
---
## LYDIA:
I feel fine.
---
## ROY:
You passed out and almost burned the house down. 
---
## ROY:
Did you eat?
---
## LYDIA:
I’m not hungry.
---
## ROY:
You should eat.
---
## LYDIA:
Roy... 
---
## LYDIA:
Do your eyes ever play tricks on you?
---
## ROY:
Like what, 
---
## ROY:
like which of these lines is shorter and they’re both the same?
---
## LYDIA:
Not optical illusions, more like you see something... 
---
## LYDIA:
just for a second.
---
## LYDIA:
And then it’s gone.
---
## ROY:
Drafty Cat. 
---
## ROY:
I think I see her walk by, but when I look, she’s not there.
---
## LYDIA:
Do you ever think I walk by, and I’m not there?
---
## ROY:
I don’t think so.
---
## LYDIA:
But if I was on your mind--
---
## ROY:
you’re always on my mind.
---
## LYDIA:
Maybe you’d daydream about me.
---
## ROY:
Is that what happened with the teapot? 
---
## ROY:
You were daydreaming about me?
---
## LYDIA:
...DeGaulle actually.
---
## ROY:
It’s always the quiet ones--
---
## LYDIA:
And playing Rock Paper Scissors.
---
## ROY:
Now I’m really jealous.
---
## LYDIA:
I just want to figure it out.
---
## ROY:
What’s to figure? 
---
## ROY:
Rock beats scissors, scissors beats--
---
## LYDIA:
To you. Not to him.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t need a doctor.
---
## ROY:
You know what?
---
## ROY:
I bet you fell asleep, right at the table.
---
## ROY:
No wonder you were light-headed in class.
---
## ROY:
Eat.

## LYDIA:
DeGaulle wants to be part of their escape.
---
## ROY:
Whose--
---
## LYDIA:
Doomsday and Lizley’s.
---
## ROY:
They’re making a break? 
---
## ROY:
How?
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t know, but DeGaulle is afraid of being left behind.
---
## ROY:
Maybe they’re working with someone on the inside...
---
## LYDIA:
It’s a mystery.
---
## ROY:
Ooh, like the Hardy Boys. 
---
## ROY:
I loved the Hardy--
---
## LYDIA:
A real mystery.
---
## LYDIA: 
I went to the library today and looked up--
---
## ROY:
On a computer?
---
## LYDIA:
hospitals in the area, and when I saw Central Psych, I knew.
---
## LYDIA:
That’s where they are.
---
## ROY:
Ooh. 
---
## ROY:
That place gave me the creeps even before they banged it up. 
---
## ROY:
My mother drove the long way home from work just to avoid it. 
---
## ROY:
Every once in a while, the town froze if one of ‘em broke loose.
---
## LYDIA:
And what, went on a killing spree?
---
## ROY:
When someone’s not right in the head, you never know.
---
## LYDIA:
They’re not dangerous.
---
## ROY:
They can flip on a dime.
---
## LYDIA:
“Normal” or Jack the Ripper, and no in between?
---
## ROY:
They’re your loonies.
---
## LYDIA:
Don’t call them that.
---
## ROY:
Nutjobs, madwhacks... 
---
## ROY:
if they’re at Psych, take your pick.
---
## LYDIA:
Maybe they just need help.
---
## ROY:
In your story?
---
## LYDIA:
In *their* story.
---
## ROY:
It’s been decades. 
---
## ROY:
There’s nobody there who needs your help.
---
## ROY:
There’s nobody there at all.

## LYDIA:
But they *are* there.

But that can’t be.

When people are buried, their graves are marked with their names.

These people are marked by bein’ here.

## DOOMSDAY:
Once they’re gone, best forget about the mark of shame.

## LYDIA:

## DOOMSDAY:
Don’t want to be reminded of depression, suicide, voices...

## LYDIA:
Roy! I figured it out!
---
## ROY:
You scared me half to death.
---
## LYDIA:
What-- Why--
---
## ROY:
When you didn’t come home after school, I called Dave. 
---
## ROY:
He said he last saw you in the library.
---
## LYDIA:
I’m getting good at the Internet. 
---
## LYDIA:
I found this site-- 
---
## LYDIA:
You wouldn’t believe-- 
---
## LYDIA:
It’s fascinating. 
---
## LYDIA:
Lincoln signed this place into existence, 
---
## LYDIA:
and they did have a bowling alley, and--
---
## LYDIA:
How did you find me?
---
## ROY:
When Dave told me, I had a hunch, 
---
## ROY:
I drove over and saw your car parked along the road. 
---
## ROY:
And then I find you running around shrieking like a loon yourself, 
---
## ROY:
and talking nonsense. 
---
## ROY:
To nobody!
---
## LYDIA:
I wasn’t.
---
## ROY:
I heard you!
---
## LYDIA:
Talking to myself. 
---
## LYDIA:
Doom was here and-
---
## ROY:
In the day? While you’re awake?
---
## LYDIA:
Lizley. But listen! 
---
## LYDIA:
I figured it out--
---
## ROY:
Here? Right here?
---
## ROY:
I don’t see anyone.
---
## LYDIA:
Well, they’re gone now. 
---
## LYDIA:
But I know what they want!
---
## LYDIA:

That’s a patient. 
---

They’re buried out here, thousands of them,

## LYDIA:
but nobody knows who’s who.

They want me to find out.
---
## ROY:
And how are you supposed to do that?

## LYDIA:
I told you, I’m getting good at the Internet.

## ROY:
This is no dream, Lydia.

You’re hearing voices. 
---
## ROY:
Seeing voices...

## LYDIA:
Call it a hunch.

I had a hunch I needed to come out here.
---
## ROY:
It’s not the same. 
---
## ROY:
I don’t talk to my hunches.
---
## LYDIA:
Doesn’t make them any less real, does it? 
---
## LYDIA:
Real enough for you to listen to it and come out here.
---
## ROY:
Why are you always smarter than me?
---
## LYDIA:
It’s not hurting anyone if I--
---
## ROY:
Let’s go to Mac’s, Lyd.

Grab a beer, relax.

Okay.

This is completely different.

How?
---
## LYDIA:
So you fixed the machine? 
---
## LYDIA:
No more false alarms?
---
## ROY:
Sure.

Once you get inside, a machine’s pretty much a machine.

## ROY:
You find what made it kink up, and fix it.

Simple.

Still, what does that say about modern medicine?

Possibly.
---
## LYDIA:
Visions.
---
## ROY:
Like Joan of Arc?
---
## LYDIA:
Why not?
---
## ROY:
We’re not religious.
---
## LYDIA:
What are other possibilities, Jack?
---
## ROY:
Not that these people actually exist and are talking to you from beyond the grave.
---
## LYDIA:
You brought me here for a professional opinion, 
---
## LYDIA:
so why don’t you let the doctor give one?
---
## ROY:
Fine. 
---
## ROY:
Tell us how to fix this, Jack.
---
## JACK:
Roy... 
---
## JACK:
We talked about--
---
## ROY:
Right, right, brains aren’t hearts. 
---
## ROY:
That’s not how it--
---
## JACK:
Remember I’m doing this as a favor, Roy.
---
## JACK:
We’re friends. Anything I say--
---
## ROY:
Out with it.
---
## JACK:
From a medical perspective--
---
## LYDIA:
What if it’s not medical?
---
## JACK:
I’m not following.
---
## LYDIA:
Children have imaginary friends, don’t they?
---
## JACK:
As a form of cognitive development, or for use in dealing with transition--
---
## ROY:
Transition like grief?
---
## LYDIA:
They can describe what these friends look like and how they behave, 
---
## LYDIA:
and parents smile and go along and set places at the dinner table.
---
## LYDIA:
Nobody thinks anything of it.
---
## JACK:
Yes, but they don’t carry into adult--
---
## LYDIA:
I teach history. 
---
## LYDIA:
My days are full of imagining people from the past. 
---
## LYDIA:
Aren’t they imaginary friends?
---
## JACK:
Relating stories is not--
---
## ROY:
Imaginary. 
---
## ROY:
She’s saying hers aren’t imaginary.
---
## LYDIA:
Of course they’re imaginary!
---
## ROY:
Okay, now we’re getting some--
---
## LYDIA:
But they’re still real. 
---
## LYDIA:
Or were.
---
## LYDIA:
Are.
---
## ROY:
She almost burned the house down.
---
## JACK:
Tell me about that.
---
## LYDIA:
I was just preoccupied. Or I fell asleep.
---
## LYDIA:
You said I probably fell asleep.
---
## ROY:
That was before I--
---
## LYDIA:
I have to call him six times
---
## ROY:
I saw it, Jack. It was--
---
## LYDIA:
for dinner during baseball season
---
## ROY:
But I hear you. I just don’t--
---
## ROY:
You couldn’t hear me.
---
## ROY:
She was playing Rock, Paper, Scissors. 
---
## ROY:
With an imaginary person.
---
## LYDIA:
With DeGaulle.
---
## JACK:
You’re speaking with Charles DeGaulle?
---
## LYDIA:
That’s just a nickname.
---
## JACK:
What are their real names?
---
## LYDIA:
Does it matter?
---
## JACK:
Technically, I presume not. 
---
## JACK:
But my biggest concern is the way they seem to intrude on your reality. 
---
## JACK:
Dreaming about them seems no cause for alarm, 
---
## JACK:
no matter how real they appear to be,
---
## JACK:
but if they’re materializing in your waking hours--
---
## LYDIA:
Mediums! 
---
## LYDIA:
They talk to dead people, right?
---
## ROY:
Next she’s gonna say I’m dead.
---
## LYDIA:
Maybe I’m a medium.
---
## JACK:
As a medical professional, I can’t subscribe to such a theory.
---
## ROY:
It’s hogwash!
---
## JACK:
No such connection has ever been-- 
---
## JACK:
Excuse me.
---
## JACK:
My ulcer. 
---
## JACK:
As I was saying, no such connection has ever been proven, 
---
## JACK:
and far too many have proven to be charlatans. 
---
## JACK:
Have you ever had these kinds of connections before? 
---
## JACK:
Even with your own mother,
---
## JACK:
who I understand is recently deceased.
---
## ROY:
Yes, and she--
---
## LYDIA:
Roy! 
---
## LYDIA:
That’s not really relevant.
---
## JACK:
Have you seen your mother?
---
## LYDIA:
No. But I’d love that!
---
## LYDIA:
Unlike my husband, I’m not freaked out by this.
---
## ROY:
Why the hell not?!
---
## JACK:
Let’s talk about it.
---
## ROY:
Maybe if she did show up, they’d all go away.
---
## JACK:
That’s what you want.
---
## ROY:
Yes!
---
## JACK:
If we formalize this relationship,
---
## JACK:
I can prescribe something. 
---
## JACK:
I’m surprised your regular doctor--
---
## ROY:
How long would it take that to work?
---
## LYDIA:
What’s my deadline, Roy? 
---
## LYDIA:
A month? 
---
## LYDIA:
Two?
---
## ROY:
I don’t want to live with them!
---
## LYDIA:
You’re not!
---
## ROY:
As long as I’m living with you, they’re along for the ride.
---
## LYDIA:
I didn’t ask them to be here. 
---
## LYDIA:
But the least I can do is make them feel welcome. 
---
## LYDIA:
Or try to do what they ask.
---
## ROY:
Oh my-- 
---
## ROY:
You don’t want-- 
---
## ROY:
What do we do with that, Jack?
---
## DEGAULLE:
Rock.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Paper.
---
## LYDIA:
Lizley’s out.
---
## ROY:
Here we go.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Hey.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Did they hurt you?
---
## LIZLEY:
...No.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Really?
---
## LIZLEY:
...Just kept me in the dark.
---
## LIZLEY:
Didn’t feed me. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Do I look thinner?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Nah, you’re still a fat pig.
---
## LIZLEY:
You really missed me, huh?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Sorry.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Can I ask you something?
---
## LIZLEY:
If it’ll pass some time.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
You ever touch a girl?
---
## LIZLEY:
How do you think I ended up in here in the first place?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Was it soft?
---
## LIZLEY:
Velvet. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Warm. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Smooth. 
---
## LIZLEY:
You mean you never--
---
## LIZLEY:
How long you been here?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
And now I’m dying,
---
## DOOMSDAY:
time to pee on the fire and call in the dogs.
---
## LIZLEY:
You’re not--
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Yes I am you brainless bulldagger. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
If we don’t get out soon, Larry will give me a number, 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
and I’ll be anonymous worms for all time.
---
## LIZLEY:
I’ll make Larry tell me where you are.
---
## LIZLEY:
And I’ll remember you.
---
## LIZLEY:
I promise.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
You never get any visitors.
---
## LIZLEY:
My brother used to come.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Nobody ever comes.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Except her.
---
## LIZLEY:
Her again?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Nobody will ever look. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
But if my name was out there, maybe someday... 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Someday...
---
## LIZLEY:
Doom...
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Soft.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Are you pretending I’m--
---
## LIZLEY:
Yeah.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I guess that’s all right.
---
## LIZLEY:
Okay?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Thank you. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
That wasn’t too-
---
## LIZLEY:
It’s okay.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
...Does it feel like you’re a lunatic? 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
In your head?
---
## LIZLEY:
No.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Sure, it’s not harm, just soft.
---
## LIZLEY:
They say I have bad germ plasm.
---
## LIZLEY:
They’re afraid I’ll reproduce 
---
## LIZLEY:
and make other deviants like me. 
---
## LIZLEY:
But don’t they know how reproduction happens?
---
## LIZLEY:
Fat chance of that.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
So you never--
---
## LIZLEY:
...Uh-uh. 
---
## LIZLEY:
And I don’t want to. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Ever.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
That’s too bad.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Hey, you wanna be an addict with me?
---
## LIZLEY:
Come on, Doom, 
---
## LIZLEY:
if I knew how to get any pills, 
---
## LIZLEY:
I’d probably have taken some myself by now.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Not you, Liz. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Your basket ain’t hung so high you can’t reach it.
---
## LIZLEY:
“God never gives you more than you can handle.”
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Until he wants you to die.
---
## LIZLEY:
Once you lose someone,
---
## LIZLEY:
it feels like you’re just biding time, doesn’t it?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
It’s not your time yet.
---
## LIZLEY:
Or yours. 
---
## LIZLEY:
No God in his right mind wants you--
---
## DOOMSDAY:
He does. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I’ve thought about it so much, parts of me are already killed.
---
## LIZLEY:
What happened to you, Doom?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Thanks for asking, Liz.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Most just wanna know what’s wrong with me.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Somethin’ insida me took all the good. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Still does.
---
## LIZLEY:
But--
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Everybody will be better off. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
And the pain will go away. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
You can have my cameras.
---
## LIZLEY:
Your what?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
They took my suitcase when I got here. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
It must be somewhere.
---
## LIZLEY:
Mine too. 
---
## LIZLEY:
With all my pictures. 
---
## LIZLEY:
They didn’t leave me a single memory of--
---
## DOOMSDAY:
You take ‘em. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Get out of here. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Sell them and go find your girl.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
And that will be the end of Sherman Seftis.
---
## LIZLEY:
Sherman?
---
## DOOMSDAY:
LEZley. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
She knows now. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
And--
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Aaargh!! 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
And I’m ready.

## LYDIA:
Sherman Seftis.
---
## ROY:
What?
---
## LYDIA:
Doomsday.
---
## LYDIA:
His real name is Sherman Seftis.

## LYDIA:
And he wants people to know that.

*Fallin'* - Connie Francis
---
## BUREAUCRAT #1:
We can’t release that information.
---
## LYDIA:
But Central Pysch is not part of the Division of Cemeteries.
---
## LYDIA:
The names need to come from you.
---
## BUREAUCRAT #1:
That is protected health information, 
---
## BUREAUCRAT #1:
and the state Office of Mental Health takes privacy seriously.
---
## LYDIA:
But many of these patients died more than a hundred years ago.
---
## LYDIA:
They weren’t even under your care.
---
## BUREAUCRAT #2:
There are laws.
---
## LYDIA:
For the living! 
---
## LYDIA:
You can get birth, death, marriage certificates 
---
## LYDIA:
from the state vital records page.
---
## BUREAUCRAT #2:
You are welcome to visit the County Clerk’s office.
---
## LYDIA:
That would take forever!
---
## BUREAUCRAT #2:
There’s always court.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t have the money for that.
---
## BUREAUCRAT #1:
Then I’m afraid we can’t help you. 
---
## BUREAUCRAT #1:
Shall I walk you out?
---
## LYDIA:
Privacy ends at death. 
---
## LYDIA:
Even confidentiality for medical records only lasts fifty years. 
---
## LYDIA:
Isn’t it time to name these abandoned souls and let them rest in peace?
---
## BUREAUCRAT #1:
What about the peace of the families?
---
## LYDIA:
Identifying their loved ones will bring them peace.
---
## BUREAUCRAT #1:
You can’t possibly speak for 6,000 families.
---
## LYDIA:
I can speak for one. 
---
## LYDIA:
I have a name. 
---
## LYDIA:
I know someone who was there.
---
## BUREAUCRAT #2:
How did you come by this information?
---
## LYDIA:
I... 
---
## LYDIA:
I was contacted by a member of the family. 
---
## LYDIA:
They...
---
## LYDIA:
They would like to put up a headstone.
---
## BUREAUCRAT #2:
Impossible.
---
## BUREAUCRAT #1:
Any violation carries a penalty of $10,000.
---
## BUREAUCRAT #1:
You cannot out families who don’t wish to be outed.
---
## LYDIA:
Or a government agency who doesn’t want anybody to know how bad it screwed up?

*Fallin'* - Connie Francis
---
## ROY:
There.
---
## ROY:
I’m so sorry. 
---
## ROY:
It’ll probably never hold tea.
---
## LYDIA:
I guess we can put it in the cabinet then.
---
## ROY:
Lydia--
---
## LYDIA:
It was bound to happen. 
---
## LYDIA:
Seven others broke before that one.
---
## ROY:
I really didn’t mean--
---
## LYDIA:
It’s just a cup.
---
## ROY:
That thing’s your best friend now.
---
## ROY:
Lydia.
---
## ROY:
Should I call Jack?
---
## ROY:
He said to let him know if-
---
## LYDIA:
I’m working.
---
## ROY:
You’re unresponsive.
---
## LYDIA:
That’s low. 
---
## LYDIA:
And that was a response. 
---
## LYDIA:
Hallelujah. 
---
## LYDIA:
I’m cured.
---
## ROY:
Do you... 
---
## ROY:
Do you think you need a cure?
---
## LYDIA:
I can’t even humor you. 
---
## LYDIA:
Stop worrying.
---
## ROY:
That’s my job. 
---
## ROY:
Love, honor, worry...
---
## LYDIA:
Sherman is a real person.
---
## ROY:
Okay: assuming that’s true--
---
## LYDIA:
It is true.
---
## ROY:
You could have read about him.
---
## LYDIA:
Where? 
---
## LYDIA:
His name isn’t anywhere. 
---
## LYDIA:
That’s the whole point.
---
## ROY:
You could’ve heard something as a kid. 
---
## ROY:
Read a death notice or maybe it was someone in your town.
---
## ROY:
There’s tons of ways a name could lodge itself in your brain for years 
---
## ROY:
and then just--pop!
---
## LYDIA:
I have the name. 
---
## LYDIA:
That’s all that matters.
---
## ROY:
One. 
---
## ROY:
Why not the rest?
---
## LYDIA:
Dummy and DeGaulle barely speak a sentence between them.
---
## ROY:
Lizley.
---
## LYDIA:
She doesn’t trust me.
---
## LYDIA:
And neither do you.
---
## ROY:
I’m trying, Lydia, but they don’t appear to me. 
---
## ROY:
They don’t play games with me, or tell me secrets, 
---
## ROY:
or crawl into my bed at night--
---
## LYDIA:
I was just tired. 
---
## LYDIA:
And she was just sitting on the bed.
---
## ROY:
You weren’t asleep.
---
## LYDIA:
I didn’t say sleeping, I said tired.
---
## ROY:
And not with me.
---
## LYDIA:
Is this about your ego?
---
## ROY:
No! My god, no! 
---
## ROY:
I just feel like... 
---
## ROY:
I mean, if you were in a coma... 
---
## ROY:
Or like I was, after surgery, with tubes and...
---
## LYDIA:
I’m right here.
---
## ROY:
But not here.
---
## ROY:
Just like I was there, in the bed, but not there. 
---
## ROY:
And you told me you were terrified I was gonna leave you.
---
## LYDIA:
I still am.
---
## ROY:
But they fixed me, Lyd. 
---
## ROY:
I can’t fix this.
---
## LYDIA:
I’m not going anywhere. 
---
## LYDIA:
But this is import-
---
## ROY:
I want to understand, I do, 
---
## ROY
but what you’re claiming is cr-- 
---
## ROY
Not possible.
---
## LYDIA:
It is possible, if you let yourself believe it.
---
## LYDIA:
My mother’s headstone is in. 
---
## LYDIA:
It’ll be installed Tuesday.
---
## ROY:
I can take off work.
---
## LYDIA:
Save your time. 
---
## LYDIA:
It’ll still be there at 5:30.
---
## LYDIA:
And the state Office of Mental Health would like to remind me 
---
## LYDIA:
of the stiff penalties for violation. 
---
## LYDIA:
I scared them. 
---
## LYDIA:
They sent this the minute I left.
---
## ROY:
How exactly did you explain what you think you “know”?
---
## LYDIA:
What do you mean?
---
## ROY:
Did you tell a roomful of bureaucrats-
---
## LYDIA:
Just two.
---
## ROY:
that you were contacted from beyond by a bunch of nutcases? 
---
## ROY:
I’m sure they took you seriously when you--
---
## LYDIA:
You don’t threaten if it’s not serious.
---
## LYDIA:
I said I was contacted by a member of Sherman’s family.
---
## ROY:
Why did you lie?
---
## LYDIA:
That’s not lying.
---
## ROY:
Were you afraid what they might say?
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t want to talk about this.
---
## ROY:
Come on, this is the closest you’ve come to admitting 
---
## ROY:
that this isn’t a normal thing going on.
---
## LYDIA:
Just because you can’t watch the switches and cogs and wires working, 
---
## LYDIA:
it’s not-- 
---
## LYDIA:
Of course I know what people might think.
---
## LYDIA:
I just didn’t think you would think it.
---
## ROY:
Lydia? 
---
## ROY:
Are they there now?
---
## LYDIA:
Pills.
---
## LIZLEY:
They’re yours.
---
## ROY:
I picked them up days ago, but you haven’t touched--
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t want them.
---
## ROY:
Just try one. 
---
## ROY:
You won’t know if you don’t try.
---
## LIZLEY:
Not now, DeGaulle! 
---
## LIZLEY:
But I showed them to you, and there you were.
---
## LYDIA:
You were trying to get my attention.
---
## LIZLEY:
Same thing.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t want them.
---
## ROY:
Meet me halfway.
---
## LIZLEY:
Not even one?
---
## LYDIA:
No. No.
---
## ROY:
Just no. 
---
## ROY:
No discussion? 
---
## ROY:
What the hell is that, Lydia?
---
## ROY:
I can’t help you if you won’t help yourself.
---
## LYDIA:
Roy--?
---
## LIZLEY:
They’re for Doom.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Scissors.
---
## LYDIA:
Not so he can--
---
## LIZLEY:
No, no. 
---
## LIZLEY:
I’m going to regulate. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Geez. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Let him blitz out, but just a little.
---
## LYDIA:
Is that a good idea?
---
## LIZLEY:
Nothing in here is a good idea. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Do you want one?
---
## LYDIA:
You said you couldn’t get pills.
---
## LIZLEY:
There’s a guard...
---
## LYDIA:
Lizley--
---
## LIZLEY:
Don’t tell Doom.
---
## LYDIA:
I won’t.
---
## LIZLEY:
Promise.
---
## LYDIA:
I promise.
---
## LIZLEY:
He needs an escape.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Scissors.
---
## LIZLEY:
I’m only giving him one.
---
## LYDIA:
One can’t hurt. 
---
## LYDIA:
Right?
---
## LIZLEY:
Just one.
---
## LIZLEY:
She’s happy to see you.
---
## LIZLEY:
It’s okay, Dummy.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Scissors.
---
## LIZLEY:
Doom! 
---
## LIZLEY:
Now you’ve gone and ruined my surprise.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Lizley, Lizley, Lizley, 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
for all the days and nights, my darlin’.
---
## LYDIA:
You’re not listening to her.
---
## LIZLEY:
Okay, then, one for you--
---
## LIZLEY:
And one for--
---
## LIZLEY:
DUMMY!
---
## DOOMSDAY:
You dumb fucking retard! 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
You dumb fucking retarded bitch!
---
## DEGAULLE:
Rock. Rock.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
You stupid dumb-- 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Aaargh!
---
## LIZLEY:
Doom! 
---
## LIZLEY:
Stop! Doom!
---
## LIZLEY:
Doom. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Give those to me.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
How did you get these?
---
## LIZLEY:
Doom--
---
## DEGAULLE:
Scissors.
---
## LIZLEY:
Doom. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Doom!
---
## LIZLEY:
You can’t leave me!
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I knew you’d find a way. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
You could sell stick matches to the devil.
---
## LIZLEY:
You can’t leave me!
---
## DOOMSDAY:
It’s okay. 
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Lydia’s here.
---
## LIZLEY:
Just one.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Paper.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
Yeah. Paper.
---
## LIZLEY:
Are you sure?
---
## LYDIA:
Absolutely.

## LIZLEY:
It really is Lesley.
---
## LYDIA:
What?
---
## LIZLEY:
My name. 
---
## LIZLEY:
I changed it because people made fun of LEZley. 
---
## LIZLEY:
And then they made fun of me because I changed it.
---
## DOOMSDAY:
I knew it.
---
## LIZLEY:
You win, Doom. 
---
## LIZLEY:
You win.
---
## ROY:
It doesn’t matter. 
---
## ROY:
All that’s waiting for me is an empty house...
---
## ROY:
full of people.

*Bye Bye Love* - The Everly Brothers
---
## ROY:
Lydia! Lydia!!
---
## LYDIA:
Roy?
---
## ROY:
Oh my god, I thought you were dead.
---
## LYDIA:
Dead? 
---
## LYDIA:
Why would I--
---
## LYDIA:
What time is it?
---
## ROY:
Never mind.
---
## LYDIA:
It’s six o’clock. 
---
## LYDIA:
Where have you been?
---
## LYDIA:
I took one Roy. 
---
## LYDIA:
For you. 
---
## LYDIA:
I took one.
---
## ROY:
How many times did you take one?
---
## LYDIA:
Once! 
---
## LYDIA:
But I couldn’t get the damned bottle open,
---
## LYDIA:
 and they spilled all over.
---
## ROY:
So where are they?
---
## LYDIA:
I picked them up... 
---
## LYDIA:
and... 
---
## LYDIA:
flushed them. I think.
---
## ROY:
Why?
---
## LYDIA:
Because they were all over the floor. 
---
## LYDIA:
And I don’t want them anyway.
---
## ROY:
Are you sure?
---
## LYDIA:
Like mother, like daughter, that’s what you think.
---
## LYDIA:
Doom took pills, not me.
---
## ROY:
Oh Lydia.
---
## LYDIA:
He took them all, and--
---
## ROY:
Lydia!
---
## LYDIA:
Lizley told me her name, Roy, 
---
## LYDIA:
so even though those weasels won’t release anything, 
---
## LYDIA:
I can still find out. 
---
## LYDIA:
I’m going to call the papers.
---
## ROY:
They kicked you out of their offices! 
---
## ROY:
You’re sitting here with an empty pill bottle! 
---
## ROY:
And you have no proof! 
---
## ROY:
Let it go.
---
## LYDIA:
I can’t.
---
## ROY:
I know! 
---
## ROY:
I’m the one shouting at you every minute to get away from the deep end, 
---
## ROY:
because if you jump-- 
---
## ROY:
But you don’t care. 
---
## ROY:
Just like--
---
## LYDIA:
Just like--
---
## ROY:
Maybe we should have had-- 
---
## ROY:
Aargh.
---
## LYDIA:
What?
---
## ROY:
Nothing.
---
## ROY:
I mean if we’d had k-- 
---
## ROY:
I’ve got nobody. 
---
## ROY:
Mac got an earful tonight, I’ll tell ya. 
---
## ROY:
And you know what he said? 
---
## ROY:
“Have another, and maybe you’ll see ‘em, too."
---
## ROY:
So I did. 
---
## ROY:
And I did.
---
## ROY:
And I did.
---
## LYDIA:
You shouldn’t be drinking like that. 
---
## LYDIA:
It’s not good for--
---
## LYDIA:
Mac’s closed hours ago.
---
## ROY:
Yeah, well. 
---
## ROY:
I considered driving home and taking my chances-- 
---
## ROY:
What the hell?
---
## LYDIA:
Why would you do that?
---
## ROY:
I didn’t. 
---
## ROY:
I slept it off instead.
---
## LYDIA:
You need to take care of yourself.
---
## ROY:
Yeah. 
---
## ROY:
How about you?
---
## LYDIA:
I took the pill. 
---
## LYDIA:
Just like you wanted.
---
## ROY:
And?
---
## LYDIA:
And Doom is gone! 
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t hear him!
---
## ROY:
That’s great! 
---
## ROY:
Maybe you should--
---
## LYDIA:
He’s dead! 
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t see him because he’s dead.
---
## ROY:
He was already dead, honey. 
---
## ROY:
Him being gone from your mind is different--
---
## LYDIA:
He killed himself!
---
## ROY:
It’s just the pills working, and it feels like a bad dream, 
---
## ROY:
because it’s forcing your brain to do what it won’t do on it’s own. 
---
## ROY:
You can have little lifesavers, too--
---
## LYDIA:
Nobody helped him! 
---
## LYDIA:
They let him die!
---
## LYDIA:
Why? Why?
---
## ROY:
Maybe you lost track... 
---
## ROY:
So I’ll just lock them up and give them to you one at--
---
## LYDIA:
I was right there and I couldn’t stop him.
---
## ROY:
I know how he feels.
---
## LYDIA:
I tried. 
---
## LYDIA:
And he just--
---
## LYDIA:
I had all these pills.
---
## ROY:
So you did take more than--
---
## LYDIA:
And he grabbed my hand-- 
---
## LYDIA:
He wanted to do it. 
---
## LYDIA:
I should have tried harder.
---
## ROY:
You did what you could.
---
## LYDIA:
It wasn’t enough.
---
## ROY:
Oh my Lydia, stop blaming yourself for what your mother did!
---
## ROY:
Be mad at her, not yourself!
---
## LYDIA:
My muh- 
---
## LYDIA:
Oh my-- 
---
## LYDIA:
This is not about my mother!
---
## ROY:
This is good. 
---
## ROY:
It’s good. 
---
## ROY:
And I’m gonna be here for you until those people are all gone, 
---
## ROY:
and you can just let it all go--
---
## LYDIA:
Let it go? 
---
## LYDIA:
Doom--Sherman. 
---
## LYDIA:
Sherman is dead. 
---
## LYDIA:
If they all die, they can’t tell me anything.
---
## ROY:
But--
---
## LYDIA:
Lizley knows. 
---
## LYDIA:
I have her name. 
---
## LYDIA:
Doom’s gone, but they still need me.
---
## ROY:
Lydia, I need you.
---
## LYDIA:
Then help me.

*Beast* - Nice Vega

## LYDIA:
Ten thousand dollars per violation! 
---
## LYDIA:
That’s more money than this entire town has made since... 
---
## LYDIA:
since the first body was buried here. 
---
## LYDIA:
But that’s the price to expose their lack of humanity. 
---
## LYDIA:
The Office of Mental Health tells me that dignifying these patients 
---
## LYDIA:
might be offensive to some families, might create stigma, 
---
## LYDIA:
especially if they live in small towns. 
---
## LYDIA:
We live in a small town, and we should find that offensive.
---
## REPORTER #1:
Don’t you have any sympathy for families who don’t want it known 
---
## REPORTER #1:
that they had a family member at Central Psych?
---
## LYDIA:
It should be an opportunity for education, not judgment.
---
## REPORTER #1:
What if it was someone in your family? 
---
## REPORTER #1:
Would you want that made public?
---
## LYDIA:
I’d like to think it would give me peace.
---
## REPORTER #2:
But wasn’t your own mother was mentally ill?
---
## ROY:
Lydia?
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t see how that--
---
## LIZLEY:
He’s doing it. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Larry’s digging for Doom.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Scissors.
---
## REPORTER #2:
And that her obituary mentioned nothing about her death being a suicide, 
---
## REPORTER #2:
just that she “died suddenly.”
---
## LYDIA:
That’s the newspaper’s way of--
---
## REPORTER #2:
Did you see it coming?
---
## LYDIA:
We were surprised--
---
## REPORTER #2:
Wouldn’t talking about your own mother be a better way 
---
## REPORTER #2:
to raise awareness than dredging up some strangers?
---
## LYDIA:
My mother’s headstone went up yesterday, with her name etched in marble. 
---
## LYDIA:
Anyone can see it. 
---
## LYDIA:
But let me show you these--
---
## REPORTER #2:
But her grave isn’t on the grounds of a psychiatric center, is it?
---
## LYDIA:
No, but I don’t see-
---
## LIZLEY:
We need to tell her.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Rock.
---
## LYDIA:
How that...
---
## LYDIA:
um... 
---
## LYDIA:
Makes any--
---
## LIZLEY:
That didn’t matter to him.
---
## LYDIA:
Um...any--
---
## LIZLEY:
and it doesn’t matter to her.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Paper.
---
## LIZLEY:
Larry’s almost done.
---
## LYDIA:
Any difference.
---
## REPORTER #2:
You don’t seem too sure of yourself.
---
## LYDIA:
No... 
---
## LYDIA:
I...um... 
---
## LYDIA:
just feel a headache coming on.
---
## ROY:
Lydia.
---
## LYDIA:
She’s coming, Roy.
---
## ROY:
Finish your speech.
---
## LIZLEY:
Four-eight-oh-nine.
---
## LYDIA:
Doom?
---
## LIZLEY:
Sherman Seftis lies here.
---
## ROY:
“Privacy ends at death,"
---
## ROY:
"and HIPPA laws say that patient confidentiality lasts fifty years--"
---
## LYDIA:
Thank you, Roy.
---
## LYDIA:
It’s been more than *one hundred years* since the first patient was buried here. 
---
## LYDIA:
Legislation could let us remember them. 
---
## LYDIA:
That’s your story. 
---
## LYDIA:
Thank you.
---
## LYDIA:
You’re right. 
---
## LYDIA:
My mother did take her own life. 
---
## LYDIA:
And I didn’t talk to anybody about it
---
## LYDIA:
And the newspapers say “died suddenly” 
---
## LYDIA:
to protect everybody from hearing about it.
---
## LYDIA:
So there it sits, in this big silence. 
---
## LYDIA:
But she might be here if I’d paid more attention.
---
## LYDIA:
If I’d understood enough-- 
---
## LYDIA:
But at least I can talk about her, and say her name: 
---
## LYDIA:
Margaret Linden Parker. 
---
## LYDIA:
That’s all I want for these people, 
---
## LYDIA:
for someone to say their names.
---
## REPORTER #1:
That was a waste of time.
---
## REPORTER #2:
Maybe the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree.
---
## ROY:
Are you all right?
---
## LYDIA:
Two reporters. 
---
## LYDIA:
Nobody cares.
---
## ROY:
Those aren’t the kind you want caring--
---
## LYDIA:
A juicy story, that’s all they want.
---
## ROY:
Which they almost got.
---
## ROY:
They might buy it’s a headache, but I know better.
---
## LYDIA:
She gave me the number!
---
## LYDIA:
Four-eight-oh-nine.
---
## LYDIA:
That’s where Doom is. 
---
## LYDIA:
Let’s find him.
---
## ROY:
Not now.
---
## LYDIA:
But you said you would help--
---
## ROY:
I helped you avoid a scandal: 
---
## LYDIA:
“Nutso teacher talks to dead people.”
---
## LYDIA:
Nutso?
---
## ROY:
I’m taking you home.
---
## LYDIA:
But we’re already here.

Let’s go.

## JACK:
and somehow it gets worse.

## JACK:
Enough about me.

What happened with the reporters?
---
## LYDIA:
What do you mean?
---
## JACK:
Roy says you... 
---
## JACK:
Lost focus. 
---
## JACK:
Does that mean--
---
## LYDIA:
They were there. 
---
## LYDIA:
Watching Larry dig-- 
---
## LYDIA:
Is it proper for Roy to report things like that to you?
---
## JACK:
He’s concerned.
---
## LYDIA:
Unnecessarily.
---
## LYDIA:
I only talk to you to shut him up.
---
## LYDIA:
I’m concerned, too. 
---
## LYDIA:
He’s been drinking.
---
## LYDIA:
Getting home all hours.
---
## JACK:
He falls asleep on my couch, Lydia. 
---
## JACK:
He’s afraid of what he might find when he goes home.
---
## LYDIA:
Afraid of--?
---
## JACK:
He said you almost took a bottle of pills.
---
## LYDIA:
He thinks I almost took a bottle of pills
---
## JACK:
Did you? Almost?
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t know. 
---
## LYDIA:
It’s hard to have a bottle of pills in your hand 
---
## LYDIA:
and not think about your mother having a bottle of pills in her hand.
---
## LYDIA:
And wonder if there’s any way that her holding a bottle 
---
## LYDIA:
and you holding a bottle is even close to the same thing. 
---
## LYDIA:
And why am I holding the bottle?
---
## LYDIA:
Does that mean I’m thinking about it? 
---
## LYDIA:
And then how do I not think about it? 
---
## LYDIA:
And is thinking about it the same as thinking about doing it?
---
## LYDIA: 
Did my mother have voices in her head? 
---
## LYDIA:
Did she have these voices? 
---
## LYDIA:
Because there are voices in my head, Jack, 
---
## LYDIA:
clear and logical voices. 
---
## LYDIA:
And I know that’s...
---
## LYDIA:
not something people understand.
---
## LYDIA:
Roy’s not saying the word, but I know what he’s afraid of. 
---
## LYDIA:
And I wonder if I don’t know enough to be afraid, too.
---
## JACK:
Can you control when they show up?
---
## LYDIA:
I-- I mean sometimes... 
---
## LYDIA:
No.
---
## JACK:
Do you wish you could?
---
## LYDIA:
I miss them if they don’t.
---
## LYDIA:
You’re going to say that’s bad, right?
---
## JACK:
How is work going?
---
## LYDIA:
I haven’t passed out again.
---
## JACK:
That’s a pretty low bar.
---
## LYDIA:
It keeps Cosgrove out of my room. 
---
## LYDIA:
The rest I... 
---
## LYDIA:
Manage.
---
## JACK:
But when you addressed the reporters-- 
---
## JACK:
You were distracted.
---
## LYDIA:
They were burying Doom!
---
## JACK:
Who killed himself?
---
## LYDIA:
Yes.
---
## JACK:
The same way your mother did.
---
## LYDIA:
Yes, but--
---
## JACK:
Because he was mentally ill.
---
## LYDIA:
He was depressed. 
---
## LYDIA:
He needed--
---
## JACK:
And now they’re laying him to rest.
---
## LYDIA:
Yes.
---
## JACK:
The day after your mother’s headstone went up?
---
## LYDIA:
Yes.
---
## JACK:
And you are grieving him.
---
## LYDIA:
Your job can’t really be that easy, Jack.
---
## JACK:
I’m just trying to help.
---
## LYDIA:
That still doesn’t explain the names.
---
## LYDIA:
Or the number.
---
## LYDIA:
Lizley told me Doom is buried at four-eight-oh-nine.
---
## JACK:
Roy told me.
---
## LYDIA:
He did?
---
## JACK:
I’ve struggled with this, Lydia. 
---
## JACK:
I know the mind can play tricks.
---
## JACK:
I know that science explains away near-death experiences
---
## JACK:
with dopamine malfunction and lack of oxygen. 
---
## JACK:
I know that we alter our memories to coincide with our beliefs. 
---
## JACK:
I know all these things and yet--
---
## LYDIA:
So you’re saying--
---
## JACK:
I don’t know everything.
---
## LYDIA:
What’s this?
---
## DEGAULLE:
Paper.
---
## JACK:
Some partial records.
---
## LYDIA:
What!
---
## LYDIA:
Lesley Morales!
---
## JACK:
Do you think that’s her?
---
## LYDIA:
It has to be, right?
---
## LYDIA:
Sherman Seft-- 
---
## LYDIA:
This part is all smudgy.
---
## JACK:
It’s an old list.
---
## LYDIA:
Where did you get this?
---
## LYDIA:
Do you know what this--
---
## JACK:
Lydia, I could lose my job, my license,
---
## JACK:
for showing that to you, let alone giving you a copy.
---
## LYDIA:
But if I can’t--
---
## JACK:
My job is to help you.
---
## JACK:
I can’t help the government, I can’t help those people. 
---
## JACK:
But maybe sharing this will help you.
---
## LYDIA:
Is this for real?
---
## JACK:
...I don’t know everything.
---
## LYDIA:
Jack, you need to let me--
---
## JACK:
No!
No.
---
## LYDIA:
But--
---
## JACK:
After some time, 
---
## JACK:
after I’ve dismissed you from my care because you no longer hear voices, 
---
## JACK:
you may announce that you received the names anonymously. 
---
## JACK:
Those who want to know if a loved one is buried 
---
## JACK:
on the grounds of Central Psych can contact you, 
---
## JACK:
but they can never go public, they can never commemorate. 
---
## JACK:
They will just know. 
---
## JACK:
That will have to be enough.
---
## LYDIA:
It’s not fair.
---
## JACK:
If fairness is worth sixty million to you...
---
## JACK:
I have no doubt they’d try to collect every last fine.
---
## LYDIA:
Maybe we can pass a plate.
---
## JACK:
I believe in you, Lydia--
---
## LYDIA:
Thank--
---
## JACK:
To do what’s right.

Yeah, why’d we do that?

So we’d live longer.

What’re you doing?

Nothing.

No.

## ROY:
I can’t find it.

## LYDIA:
I haven’t seen it.

## ROY:
Did you throw it out?
---
## LYDIA:
Maybe you threw it out and don’t remember.
---
## LYDIA:
Alice Watson.
---
## ROY:
He’s feeding your obsession.
---
## LYDIA:
You wanted something to excite me. 
---
## LYDIA:
You wanted me to have a purpose. 
---
## LYDIA:
And now that I--
---
## ROY:
Take a class! 
---
## ROY:
Become a docent! 
---
## ROY:
Plant a garden! 
---
## ROY:
Play video games, for crying out loud!
---
## LYDIA:
Obsession sounds crazy. 
---
## LYDIA:
This is a mission. 
---
## LYDIA:
I’ve got Alvarez working on a website, and there are genealogy sites. 
---
## LYDIA:
There are ways if I can just get the word out... 
---
## LYDIA:
Charles Deggerman...
---
## ROY:
Jack agreed that this could be a way of coping with your mother.
---
## LYDIA:
You shouldn’t talk to him about me.
---
## ROY:
You’ve got these... 
---
## ROY:
people to talk to all day, but who do I have?
---
## LYDIA:
It’s not ethical.
---
## ROY:
Neither was giving you those names.
---
## ROY:
I’m trying to understand.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t even understand.
---
## ROY:
Okay then, so consider. 
---
## ROY:
If it’s a way of coping, your subconscious is trying to sort things out. 
---
## ROY:
And so maybe it’s flipping through your brain looking for clues, 
---
## ROY:
and it dredged up a couple names from--
---
## LYDIA:
Names that just happened to be on this list.
---
## ROY:
You want me to think about your possibility, so you have to think about--
---
## LYDIA:
Okay.
---
## ROY:
Thank you.
---
## LYDIA:
It’s possible that I forgot my habit 
---
## LYDIA:
of religiously reading obituaries in grammar school. 
---
## LYDIA:
And highlighting all the names who died in Central Psych 
---
## LYDIA:
so that my brain would be sure to file them all in the same drawer 
---
## LYDIA:
to retrieve one by one when the time was right.
---
## ROY:
Just one. 
---
## ROY:
You only came up with one.
---
## LYDIA:
Two!
---
## ROY:
One and a half.
---
## LYDIA:
Oh Roy.
---
## ROY:
Then why no more names, Lydia? 
---
## ROY:
And why didn’t they tell you more? 
---
## ROY:
You’re like the psychic who swears to know everything that’s coming 
---
## ROY:
except lottery numbers.
---
## LYDIA:
If I claimed psychic powers, would you still think I was--?
---
## ROY:
Can you get the numbers?
---
## LYDIA:
How much cash would it take to convince you?
---
## ROY:
It’s going to take you forever to go through those.
---
## LYDIA:
Nonsense. I’ve already done ten.
---
## ROY:
But if you can’t-- 
---
## ROY:
What does it matter--

## LYDIA:
If I can confirm in some way beyond Jack’s list... 
---
## LYDIA:
it’s public information. 
---
## LYDIA:
And the State can’t do anything if I try to find a relative.
---
## LYDIA:
They own the cemetery, they own the names, 
---
## LYDIA:
but I don’t have to let them own the people.
---
## LYDIA:
They shouldn’t get to choose who gets remembered!
---
## ROY:
They do it all the time. 
---
## ROY:
Bad Company’s still not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
---
## LYDIA:
Their families--
---
## ROY:
They don’t get to decide either. 
---
## ROY:
Doesn’t mean they don’t belong there--
---
## ROY:
just like the Teachers Wall.
---
## LYDIA:
But life is sacred.
---
## LYDIA:
The idea--
---
## ROY:
Lydia.
---
## LYDIA:
that anyone would decide it’s not--
---
## ROY:
Lydia.
---
## ROY:
If your mother was right in the head, she wouldn’t’ve done it.
---
## LYDIA:
You’re defending her now?
---
## ROY:
I’m just saying--
---
## LYDIA:
It wasn’t selfish.
---
## ROY:
Maybe not, but that doesn’t mean--
---
## LYDIA:
Mentally ill and not planning a killing spree?
---
## ROY:
Lydia--
---
## LYDIA:
She wasn’t some “loon”.
---
## ROY:
No, honey, she wasn’t. 
---
## ROY:
And I miss her, too.
---
## LYDIA:
So many people loved her.
---
## LYDIA: 
But they didn’t all show up at the funeral,
---
## LYDIA:
and the ones who did avoided me, 
---
## LYDIA:
or whispered in corners. 
---
## LYDIA:
Some of my best friends looked past me at the flowers 
---
## LYDIA:
while they told me how sorry they were. 
---
## LYDIA:
And now... 
---
## LYDIA:
Nothing.
---
## LYDIA:
It’s like they forgot she existed.
---
## ROY:
You won’t let anyone forget. 
---
## ROY:
That doesn’t mean you have to do it for everyone. 
---
## ROY:
Or even these four people.
---
## ROY:
Especially because it’s...
---
## LYDIA:
What?
---
## ROY:
Messing with your head.
---
## LYDIA:
What are you saying?
---
## ROY:
Just--
---
## LYDIA:
Say it.
---
## ROY:
Have you told anybody besides me?
---
## LYDIA:
I haven’t really seen anybody.
---
## ROY:
Because you’re in the library at lunch. 
---
## ROY:
You skipped teacher movie night.
---
## ROY:
You didn’t want to go to the neighborhood potluck. 
---
## ROY:
Is it because you have enough company already?
---
## ROY:
Well, okay then.
---
## LYDIA:
I’m not going to hurt myself.
---
## ROY:
Maybe not on purpose.
---
## ROY:
You got the names, now let someone else take over. 
---
## ROY:
Let’s go to Mexico.
---
## ROY:
It doesn’t have to be you.
---
## LYDIA:
Yes it does.
---
## ROY:
Why?
---
## LYDIA:
They asked.
---
## ROY:
And what if they ask you to burn the house down?
---
## LYDIA:
Charles Deggerman. 
---
## LYDIA:
Do you think that’s DeGaulle?
---
## ROY:
Gee, I don’t know, why don’t you ask him?
---
## LYDIA:
I can’t believe I didn’t think of--
---
## LYDIA:
Are you Charles Deggerman?
---
## DEGAULLE:
Scissors.
---
## LIZLEY:
He doesn’t know.
---
## ROY:
They’re right there?
---
## LYDIA:
They’re always there.
---
## ROY:
All of them? 
---
## ROY:
Always?
---
## LYDIA:
Just not always... 
---
## LYDIA:
there, you know?
---
## LYDIA:
What about Deiter Hendrick. 
---
## LYDIA:
Mark Turvin. 
---
## LYDIA:
Santino Lopez, 
---
## LYDIA:
John Jablonski, 
---
## LYDIA:
Bruno--
---
## LIZLEY:
I don’t know.
---
## LYDIA:
It doesn’t matter. 
---
## LYDIA:
It doesn’t prove anything if you tell me.
---
## LIZLEY:
Keep going. 
---
## LIZLEY:
I like hearing the names.
---
## LYDIA:
Frank Vandopolous, 
---
## LYDIA:
Barney Abraham,
---
## LYDIA:
Seymour Severino, 
---
## LYDIA:
Barney--
---
## ROY:
Ask them how much gas is!
---
## LYDIA:
What?
---
## ROY:
The price of gas. 
---
## ROY:
Ask them how much.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t--
---
## ROY:
Just ask!
---
## LYDIA:
How much... 
---
## LYDIA:
how much is gas?
---
## LIZLEY:
What?
---
## LYDIA:
A gallon of gas? 
---
## LYDIA:
How much does that cost?
---
## LIZLEY:
How the hell should I know? 
---
## LIZLEY:
You think I ever sit behind a wheel?
---
## LYDIA:
She doesn’t know.
---
## ROY:
Ha!
---
## LYDIA:
She’s locked up, Roy. 
---
## LYDIA:
Patricia Heath, 
---
## LYDIA:
Abigail Swenson--
---
## ROY:
Okay, okay... 
---
## ROY:
ask... 
---
## ROY:
who won the last Super Bowl... 
---
## ROY:
no, there wasn’t one... 
---
## ROY:
the World Series.
---
## LYDIA:
You know who won the World Series.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Yankees.
---
## ROY:
But do they?
---
## LYDIA:
Yankees. 
---
## LYDIA:
What are you trying--
---
## ROY:
Lucky guess. 
---
## ROY:
Trivia proves nothing.
---
## LYDIA:
So stop asking.
---
## ROY:
Nothing. 
---
## ROY:
Ask about... 
---
## ROY:
the machines!
---
## LYDIA:
The mach--
---
## ROY:
Any machine!
---
## ROY:
Ask them to describe a machine there.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t--
---
## ROY:
Lydia.
---
## LYDIA:
My husband...
---
## LYDIA:
He would like to know about the machines at your hospital. 
---
## LYDIA:
I’m sorry.
---
## LIZLEY:
Machines?
---
## LYDIA:
Any machine, I guess.
---
## LIZLEY:
Um... 
---
## LIZLEY:
Like a blood pressure machine?
---
## LYDIA:
Blood pressure?
---
## LYDIA:
Yeah. What’s that like?
---
## LIZLEY:
Just a... thing. 
---
## LIZLEY:
A wooden box. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Looks like a clock.
---
## LYDIA:
A wood clock thing, okay. 
---
## LYDIA:
Can I please get back to--
---
## ROY:
Wood?
---
## LYDIA:
That’s what she said.
---
## LYDIA:
Now...
---
## LYDIA:
Emily Albright, 
---
## LYDIA:
Edmond Brody, 
---
## LYDIA:
Harold Smith--
---
## LIZLEY:
Yes. He was here.
---
## LYDIA:
Harold Smith was a patient?
---
## LYDIA:
Lizley says Harold Smith was there.
---
## ROY:
Harold Smith? 
---
## ROY:
And Bob Jones. 
---
## ROY:
Don’t forget him.
---
## LYDIA:
You still think I’m making it up?
---
## ROY:
One more question.
---
## LYDIA:
There’s no point--
---
## ROY:
Ask them-
---
## LYDIA:
No more questions.
---
## ROY:
To leave you alone.
---
## LYDIA:
What?
---
## ROY:
To disappear. 
---
## ROY:
Let you be.
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t think--
---
## ROY:
Have you ever tried?
---
## LYDIA:
No.
---
## ROY:
How do you know it won’t work?
---
## LYDIA:
But I--
---
## ROY:
Ask them.
---
## LYDIA:
I can’t just...
---
## LYDIA:
abandon them.
---
## LIZLEY:
You’re leaving?!
---
## DEGAULLE:
Scissors.
---
## ROY:
For me, Lyd. 
---
## ROY:
Please.
---
## LYDIA:
Don’t make me do this.
---
## LYDIA:
I know if I just--
---
## ROY:
Ask them.
---
## LYDIA:
Roy.
---
## ROY:
I’m calling Jack.
---
## LYDIA:
What-- Why?
---
## LYDIA:
He gave me the names. 
---
## LYDIA:
He wouldn’t do that if he didn’t believe me.
---
## ROY:
Wouldn’t he?
---
## LYDIA:
You don’t think it’s a real list?
---
## ROY:
Maybe a stronger med--
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t need more drugs! 
---
## LYDIA:
If I’m doped up--
---
## ROY:
They’ll go away?
---
## LYDIA:
I’ll go away!
---
## ROY:
You’re not here now!
---
## LYDIA:
You think I belong with them?
---
## ROY:
You belong with me.
---
## LYDIA:
Roy! 
---
## LYDIA:
Roy!
---
## LIZLEY:
Keep reading. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Please.

John Wanderhause,

---
## LYDIA:
Dawn Crowley, 
---
## LYDIA:
Alexander Haas-- 
---
## LYDIA:
What’s the point?
---
## LIZLEY:
Saying their names. 
---
## LIZLEY:
It’s the only time anyone ever will.
---
## LYDIA:
...Chambers Booth, 
---
## LYDIA:
Sherman--
---
## LYDIA:
Sherman.
---
## LYDIA:
George Bellamy, 
---
## LYDIA:
Juanita Gonzalez,

## LYDIA:
Rebecca Linden-- 
---
## LYDIA:
Rebecca Linden.
---
## LIZLEY:
Yes!
---
## LYDIA:
Rebecca Linden. 
---
## LYDIA:
Is my grandmother.
---
## LIZLEY:
Rebecca Linden is--
---
## LYDIA:
No. No.
---
## LIZLEY:
That’s her name.
---
## LYDIA:
Why didn’t you tell me before?
---
## LIZLEY:
I forgot.
---
## LYDIA:
She died before I was born.
---
## LIZLEY:
Here. 
---
## LIZLEY:
Dead. 
---
## LIZLEY:
What’s the difference?
---
## LYDIA:
But she-- 
---
## LYDIA:
Her eyes.
---
## LYDIA:
How did I not see that? 
---
## LYDIA:
How did I not see that? 
---
## LYDIA:
She-- 
---
## LYDIA:
Like my mother.
---
## LYDIA:
How did she get here?
---
## LIZLEY:
I don’t know.
---
## LIZLEY:
They don’t let dummies have babies. 
---
## LIZLEY:
More bad germ plasm.
---
## LYDIA:
My mother--
---
## LYDIA:
Yes. 
---
## LYDIA:
Your baby, my mother-- 
---
## LYDIA:
She’s--
---
## LYDIA:
Yes. She--
---
## LYDIA:
At rest.
---
## DEGAULLE:
Paper.
---
## ROY:
Lydia!
---
## LYDIA:
Roy! 
---
## LYDIA:
She’s my grandmother! 
---
## LYDIA:
My grandmother! 
---
## LYDIA:
Now do you believe me? 
---
## LYDIA:
It all makes so much sense.
---
## ROY:
It makes no sense. 
---
## ROY:
Who is your grandmother?
---
## LYDIA:
Dummy. 
---
## LYDIA:
Rebecca. 
---
## LYDIA:
My mother’s mother!
---
## ROY:
I thought she was dead.
---
## LYDIA:
She is!
---
## ROY:
So you’ve heard her name before.
---
## LYDIA:
That’s how I recognized it.
---
## ROY:
So?
---
## LYDIA:
So... she’s here! 
---
## LYDIA:
I have a grandmother!
---
## LYDIA:
Did you hear that?
---
## ROY:
Dummy?
---
## LYDIA:
Rebecca.
---
## ROY:
She’s talking now?
---
## LYDIA:
Of course not.
---
## ROY:
I didn’t think so.
---
## LYDIA:
I found my grandmother.
---
## ROY:
Jack’ll be here soon.
---
## LYDIA:
So what?
---
## ROY:
So... so... 
---
## ROY:
I’m going to recommend... 
---
## ROY:
that he sign you to our psychiatric unit. 
---
## ROY:
Just for evaluation. If you won’t--
---
## LYDIA:
I need to be here. 
---
## LYDIA:
Nothing, nobody, in there will help me!
---
## ROY:
Nothing out here is helping you!
---
## LYDIA:
Roy? 
---
## LYDIA:
Do you need your pills?
---
## ROY:
My heart’s been breaking all along, and you can’t see it. 
---
## ROY:
Where are you, Lydia?
---
## LYDIA:
At peace. 
---
## LYDIA
Be peaceful with me.
---
## LYDIA
Don’t do this.
---
## ROY:
I don’t know what else to do.
---
## ROY:
Come on, Jack--
---
## LYDIA:
You found your robe!
---
## ROY:
Curled up in a ball under the bed, Lydia. 
---
## LYDIA
With these in the pocket.
---
## LYDIA:
They must have fallen under there when they spilled.
---
## ROY:
You’re killing me. 
---
## ROY:
I might as well stuff these pills down my own throat because you’re killing me.
---
## LYDIA:
If you would just--
---
## ROY:
Watch you slip away?
---
## ROY:
I can’t.

## JACK:
This doesn’t look like an emergency, Roy.
---
## ROY:
A minute ago, she was sobbing uncontrollably, 
---
## ROY:
saying one of those ghosts is her grandmother!
---
## JACK:
Lydia?
---
## LYDIA:
She is my grandmother. 
---
## LYDIA:
Her name was on the list you gave me, 
---
## LYDIA:
and Lizley says it’s Dummy.
---
## JACK:
And--
---
## LYDIA:
And I believe her.
---
## LYDIA:
I told her about my mother.
---
## JACK:
How did that feel?
---
## LYDIA:
Like... 
---
## LYDIA:
like the whole point.
---
## ROY:
This is crazy! 
---
## ROY:
Jack--

## LYDIA:
Can’t you believe in, I don’t know, 
---
## LYDIA:
Miracles? 
---
## LYDIA:
Patients declared dead who come back to life? 
---
## LYDIA:
People appearing right when you need them?
---
## ROY:
But this is just-- 
---
## ROY:
Just for an evaluation, Jack.
---
## JACK:
It’s a slippery slope, Roy.
---
## LYDIA:
Roy, this is good. 
---
## LYDIA:
Since my mother died, I’ve been-- 
---
## LYDIA:
I know, but right now, I feel... 
---
## LYDIA:
Calm. 
---
## LYDIA:
And loved.
---
## JACK:
Hard to argue with that, Roy.
---
## ROY:
Does that mean they’re gone, Lydia? 
---
## ROY:
Now that you’ve figured it out, are they gone?
---
## LYDIA:
I don’t hear them.
---
## JACK:
But-- 
---
## JACK:
Listen to me carefully, Lydia. 
---
## JACK:
Are they gone?
---
## JACK:
Lydia?
---
## LYDIA:
Yes. 
---
## LYDIA:
Yes, they’re gone.
---
## ROY:
Thank god!
---
## ROY:
They’ll stay gone right? 
---
## ROY:
Finding her grandmother--
---
## ROY:
I can’t believe I’m saying this--
---
## ROY:
is the end, right?
---
## JACK:
Lydia is at peace.
---
## ROY:
That’s all I ever wanted.
---
## JACK:
I wish all my cases resolved themselves so satisfactorily.
---
## ROY:
But--

## JACK:
The mind is a mysterious thing, Roy.

## JACK:
It’s best not to overthink it.

I’m sorry I couldn’t do more, Sherman.

## LYDIA:
But I know you’re here, and the website is up...

## LYDIA:
Your family will call me, and I’ll tell them exactly where to find you.

## LYDIA:
Four-eight-zero-nine.

In numerology, that’s a good number for artists.

And inspirational people.

I’ll visit.

I’ll even mention you in my acceptance speech for the Teachers Wall,

because I wouldn’t have gotten there without you.

You won’t ever be alone or forgotten as long as I’m around.

You were the voice for all of them.

It doesn’t seem--

I don’t understand.

You’re not going?

Yes. For all of them.
