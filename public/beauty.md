[heavy rain]
---
---
## MAG:
Wet, Maureen?
---
## MAUREEN:
Of course wet.
---
## MAG:
Oh…
---
## MAG:
I did take me Complan.
---
## MAUREEN:
So you *can* get it yourself, so.
---
## MAG:
I can.
---
## MAG:
Although lumpy it was, Maureen.
---
## MAUREEN:
Well, can I help lumpy?
---
## MAG:
No.
---
## MAUREEN:
Write to the Complan people, so, if it's lumpy.
---
## MAG:
You do make me Complan nice and smooth.
---
## MAG:
Not a lump at all, nor the comrade of a lump.
---
## MAUREEN:
You don't give it a good enough stir is what you don't do.
---
## MAG:
I gave it a good enough stir and there was still lumps.
---
## MAUREEN:
You probably pour the water in too fast, so.
---
## MAUREEN:
What it says on the box, you're supposed to ease it in.
---
## MAG:
Mm.
---
## MAUREEN:
That's where you do go wrong.
---
## MAUREEN:
Have another go tonight for yourself and you'll see.
---
## MAG:
Mm.
---
## MAG:
And the hot water, too, I do be scared of.
---
## MAG:
Scared I may scald meself.
---
## MAG:
I do be scared, Maureen.
---
## MAG:
I be scared what if me hand shook and I was to pour it over me hand.
---
## MAG:
And with you at Mary Pender's, then where would I be?
---
## MAUREEN:
You're just a hypochondriac is what you are.
---
## MAG:
I'd be lying on the floor and I'm not a hypochondriac.
---
## MAUREEN:
You are too and everybody knows that you are.
---
## MAUREEN:
Full well.
---
## MAG:
Don't I have a urine infection if I'm such a hypochon­driac?
---
## MAUREEN:
I can't see how a urine infection prevents you pouring a mug of Complan,
---
## MAUREEN:
or tidying up the house a bit when I'm away.
---
## MAUREEN:
It wouldn't kill you.
---
## MAG:
Me bad back.
---
## MAUREEN:
Your bad back.
---
## MAG:
And me bad hand.
---
## MAUREEN: (quietly)
Feck…
---
## MAUREEN: (irritated)
I'll get your Complan so if it's such a big job!
---
## MAUREEN: (irritated)
From now and 'til doomsday!
---
## MAUREEN:
The one thing I ask you to do.
---
## MAUREEN:
Do you see Annette or Margo coming pouring your Complan,
---
## MAUREEN:
or buying your ol' cod in butter sauce for the week?
---
## MAG:
No.
---
## MAUREEN:
"No" is right, you don't.
---
## MAUREEN:
And carrying it up that hill.
---
## MAUREEN:
And still I'm not appreciated.
---
## MAG:
You *are* appreciated, Maureen.
---
## MAUREEN:
I'm not appreciated.
---
## MAG:
I'll give me Complan another go, so, and give it a good stir for meself.
---
## MAUREEN:
Ah, forget your Complan.
---
## MAUREEN:
I'm expected to do everything else,
---
## MAUREEN:
I suppose that one on top of it won't hurt.
---
## MAUREEN:
Just a…
--
just a blessed fecking skivvy is all I'm thought of!
---
## MAG:
You're not, Maureen.
---
template: noise
[cupboard doors slam]
---
## MAG:
Me porridge, Maureen, I haven't had…will you be getting?
---
## MAG:
No, in a minute, Maureen, have a rest for yourself…
---
---
## MAG:
Will we have the radio on for ourselves?
---
---
template: noise
[radio, crackling with static, plays a Gaelic song]
---
## MAG:
The dedication Annette and Margo sent—we still haven't heard.
---
## MAG:
I wonder what's keeping it?
---
## MAUREEN:
If they sent a dedication at all.
---
## MAUREEN:
They only said they did.

[sniff]
---
## MAUREEN:
Is there a smell off this sink now, I'm wondering…
---
## MAG: (defensively)
No.
---
## MAUREEN:
I hope there's not, now.
---
## MAG:
No smell at all is there, Maureen.
---
## MAG:
I do promise, now.
---
## MAG:
Is the radio a *biteen* loud there, Maureen?
---
## MAUREEN:
A *biteen* loud, is it?
---
template: noise
[radio switches off]
---
## MAG:
Nothing on it, anyways.
---
## MAG:
An ol' fella singing nonsense.
---
## MAUREEN:
Isn't it you wanted it set for that ol' station?
---
## MAG:
Only for Ceilidh Time and for what-you-call.
---
## MAUREEN:
It's too late to go complaining now.
---
## MAG:
Not for nonsense did I want it set.
---
## MAUREEN:
It isn't nonsense anyways.
---
## MAUREEN:
Isn't it Irish?
---
## MAG:
It sounds like nonsense to me.
---
## MAG:
Why can't they just speak English like everybody?
---
## MAUREEN:
Why should they speak English?
---
## MAG:
To know what they're saying.
---
## MAUREEN:
What country are you living in?
---
## MAG:
Eh?
---
## MAUREEN:
What country are you living in?
---
## MAG:
Galway.
---
## MAUREEN:
Not what county!
---
## MAG:
Oh…
---
## MAUREEN:
Ireland you're living in!
---
## MAG:
*Ireland*.
---
## MAUREEN:
So why should you be speaking English in Ire­land?
---
## MAG:
I don't know why.
---
## MAUREEN:
It's Irish you should be speaking in Ireland.
---
## MAG:
It is.
---
## MAUREEN:
Eh?
---
## MAG:
Eh?
---
## MAUREEN:
"Speaking English in Ireland."
---
## MAG:
Except where would Irish get you going for a job in England?
---
## MAG:
Nowhere.
---
## MAUREEN:
Well, isn't that the crux of the matter?
---
## MAG:
Is it, Maureen?
---
## MAUREEN:
If it wasn't for the English stealing our language,
---
## MAUREEN:
and our land,
---
## MAUREEN:
and our God-knows-what,
---
## MAUREEN:
wouldn't it be we wouldn't need to go over there…
---
## MAUREEN:
begging for jobs and for hand­ outs?
---
## MAG:
I suppose that's the crux of the matter.
---
## MAUREEN:
It *is* the crux of the matter.
---
## MAG:
Except America, too.
---
## MAUREEN:
What—except America, too?
---
## MAG:
If it was to America you had to go begging for handouts,
---
## MAG:
it isn't Irish would be any good to you.
---
## MAG:
It would be English!
---
## MAUREEN:
Isn't that the same crux of the same matter?
---
## MAG:
I don't know if it is or it isn't.
---
## MAUREEN:
Bringing up kids to think all they'll ever be good for…
---
## MAUREEN:
is begging handouts from the English and the Yanks.
---
## MAUREEN:
That's the selfsame crux.
---
## MAG:
I suppose.
---
## MAUREEN:
Of course you suppose, because it's true.
---
## MAG:
If I had to go begging for handouts anywhere,
---
## MAG:
I'd rather beg for them in America than in England,
---
## MAG:
because in America it does be more sunny anyways.
---
## MAG:
Or is that just something they say?
---
## MAG:
That the weather is more sunny, Maureen?
---
## MAG:
Or is that a lie, now?
---
## MAUREEN:
You're ol' and you're stupid
---
## MAUREEN:
and you don't know what you're talking about.
---
## MAUREEN:
Now shut up and eat your ol' por­ridge.
---
## MAG:
Me mug of tea you forgot!
---
---
## MAG:
Did you meet anybody on your travels, Maureen?
---
---
## MAG:
Ah no, not on a day like today.
---
## MAG:
Although you don't say hello to people is your trouble, Maureen.
---
## MAG:
Although some people it would be better not to say hello to.
---
## MAG:
The fella up and murdered the poor ol' woman in Dublin…
---
## MAG:
and he didn't even know her.
---
## MAG:
The news that story was on, did you hear of it?
---
## MAG:
Strangled, and didn't even know her.
---
## MAG:
That's a fella it would be better not to talk to.
---
## MAG:
That's a fella it would be better to avoid outright.
---
## MAUREEN:
Sure, that sounds exactly the type of fella I would *like* to meet,
---
## MAUREEN:
and then bring him home to meet you,
---
## MAUREEN:
if he likes murdering ol' women.
---
## MAG:
That's not a nice thing to say, Maureen.
---
## MAUREEN:
Is it not, now?
---
## MAG:
Sure, why would he be coming all this way out from Dublin?
---
## MAG:
He'd just be going out of his way.
---
## MAUREEN:
For the pleasure of me company he'd come.
---
## MAUREEN:
Killing you, it'd just be a bonus for him.
---
## MAG:
Killing *you* I bet he first would be.
---
## MAUREEN:
I could live with that so long as I was sure he'd be clobbering you soon after.
---
## MAUREEN:
If he clobbered you with a big axe or something and took your ol' head off and spat in your neck,
---
## MAUREEN:
I wouldn't mind at all, going first.
---
## MAUREEN:
Oh no, I'd enjoy it, I would.
---
## MAUREEN:
No more ol' Complan to get, and no more ol' porridge to get, and no more…
---
## MAG:
No sugar in this, Mau­reen, you forgot—
--
go and get me some.

It's Ray Dooley, Missus.

From over the way.

Dooley?

Ray Dooley, aye.

## RAY: (offstage)
You know me.

Are you one of the Dooleys, so?

I am. I'm Ray.

Oh…

## RAY: (irritated)
Well, will you let me in or am I going to talk to the door?

She's feeding the chickens.

## MAG:
Have you gone?

## RAY: (angrily)
Open the ol' door, Missus!

Haven't I walked a mile out of me way just to get here?

Have you?

I have.

Thank you!

## RAY:
An hour I thought you'd be keeping me waiting.
---
## MAG:
Oh, it's you, so it is.
---
## RAY:
Of course it's me, who else?
---
## MAG:
You're the Dooley with the uncle.
---
## RAY:
It's only a million times you've seen me the past twenty year.
---
## RAY:
Aye, I'm the Dooley with the uncle…
---
## RAY:
and it's me uncle the message is.
---
## MAG:
Maureen's at the chickens.
---
## RAY:
You've said Maureen's at the chickens.
---
## RAY:
What's on the telly?
---
## MAG:
I was waiting for the news.
---
## RAY:
You'll have a long wait.
---
## MAG:
I was combing me hair.
---
## RAY:
I think it's *The Sullivans*.
---
## MAG:
I don't know what it is.
---
## RAY:
You do get a good reception.
---
## MAG:
A middling reception.
---
## RAY:
Everything's Australian nowadays.
---
## MAG:
I don't know if it is or it isn't.
---
---
## MAG:
At the chickens, Maureen is.
---
## RAY:
That's three times now you've told me Maureen's at the chickens.
---
## RAY:
Are you going for the world's record in saying “Mau­reen's at the chickens’?"
---
## MAG:
She's feeding them.
---
## RAY:
Well, I'm not wading through all that skitter just to tell her.
---
## RAY:
I've done enough wading.
---
## RAY:
Coming up that ol' hill.
---
## MAG:
It's a big ol' hill.
---
## RAY:
It *is* a big ol' hill.
---
## MAG:
Steep.
---
## RAY:
Steep is right…and if not steep, then muddy.
---
## MAG:
Muddy and rocky.
---
## RAY:
Muddy and rocky is right—uh-huh.
---
## RAY:
How do ye two manage up it every day?
---
## MAG:
We do drive.
---
## RAY:
Of course.
---
## RAY:
That's what I want to do is drive.
---
## RAY:
I'll have to be getting driving lessons.
---
## RAY:
And a car.
---
## RAY:
Not a good one, like.
---
## RAY:
A secondhand one, y'know?
---
## MAG:
A used one.
---
## RAY:
A used one, aye.
---
## MAG:
Off somebody.
---
## RAY:
Ol’ Father Welsh—
--
Walsh—
--
has a car he's selling,
---
## RAY:
but I'd look a poof buying a car off a priest.
---
## MAG:
I don't like Father Walsh—
---
## MAG:
—Welsh—
--
At all.
---
## RAY:
He punched Mairtin Hanlon in the head once…
---
## RAY:
and for no reason.
---
## MAG:
God love us!
---
## RAY:
Aye.
---
## RAY:
Although, now, that was out of character for Father Welsh.
---
## RAY:
Father Welsh seldom uses violence, same as most young priests.
---
## RAY:
It's usually only the older priests go punching you in the head.
---
## RAY:
I don't know why.
---
## RAY:
I suppose it's the way they were brought up.
---
## MAG:
There was a priest the news Wednesday had a baby with a Yank!
---
## RAY:
That's no news at all.
---
## RAY:
That's everyday.
---
## RAY:
It'd be hard to find a priest who hasn't had a baby with a Yank.
---
## RAY:
If he'd punched that baby in the head, that'd be news.
---
## RAY:
Aye. Anyways.
---
## RAY:
Aye. What was I saying?
---
## RAY:
Oh aye, so if I give you the message, Missus,
---
## RAY:
you'll be passing it on to Maureen?
---
## RAY:
So you will, or will I be writing it down for you?
---
## MAG:
I'll be passing it on.
---
## RAY:
Good-o.
---
## RAY:
Me brother Pato said to invite you to our uncle's going-away do.
---
## RAY:
The Riordan's hall out in Carraroe.
---
## MAG:
Is your brother back, so?
---
## RAY:
He is.
---
## MAG:
Back from England?
---
## RAY:
Back from England, aye.
---
## RAY:
England's where he was, so that's where he would be back from.
---
## RAY:
Our Yankee uncle's going home to Boston after his holiday
---
## RAY:
and taking those two ugly duck­ling daughters back with him…
---
## RAY:
and that Dolores what-you-call…
--
Healey or Hooley…
---
## RAY:
so there'll be a little to-do in the Riordan's as a goodbye,
---
## RAY:
or a *big* to-do knowing them show-off bastards,
---
## RAY:
and free food, anyways, so me brother says you're welcome to come…
---
## RAY:
or Maureen anyways, he knows you don't like getting out much.
---
## RAY:
Isn't it you has the bad hip?
---
## MAG:
No.
---
## RAY:
Oh.
---
## RAY:
Who is it has the bad hip, so?
---
## MAG:
I don't know.
---
## MAG:
I do have the urine infection.
---
## RAY:
Maybe that's what I was thinking of.
---
## RAY:
And thanks for telling me.
---
## MAG:
Me urine.
---
## RAY:
I know, your urine.
---
## MAG:
And me bad back.
---
## MAG:
And me burned hand.
---
## RAY:
Aye, aye, aye.
---
## RAY:
Anyways, you'll be passing the message on to that one.
---
## MAG:
Eh?
---
## RAY:
You'll be remembering the message to pass it on to that one?
---
## MAG:
Aye.
---
## RAY:
Say it back to me, so.
---
## MAG:
Say it back to you?
---
## RAY:
Aye.
---
---
## MAG:
About me hip…?
---
## RAY: (angrily)
I should've fecking written it down in the first fecking place, I fecking knew!
---
## RAY:
And save all this fecking time!

## RAY:
Talking with a loon!

## MAG:
Do me a mug of tea while you're here, Pato—

## MAG:
Do me a mug of tea while you're here, ~~Pato~~—um, *Ray*.
---
## RAY:
*Ray* my fecking name is!
---
## RAY:
Pato's me fecking brother!

## MAG:
I do forget.

## RAY:
It's like talking to a…

talking to a…

## MAG:
Brick wall?
---
## RAY:
Brick wall is right.
---
## MAG:
Or some soup, do me.
---
## RAY:
There.
---
## RAY:
Forget about soup.
---
## RAY:
The message is there.
---
## RAY:
Point that one in the direction of it when she returns from beyond.
---
## RAY:
The Riordan's hall out in Carraroe.
---
## RAY:
Seven o'clock tomorrow night.
---
## RAY:
Free food.
---
## RAY:
Okay?
---
## MAG:
All right now, Ray.
---
## MAG:
Are you still in the choir nowadays, Ray?
---
## RAY:
I am *not* in the choir nowadays.
---
## RAY:
Isn't it ten years since I was in the choir?
---
## MAG:
Doesn't time be flying?
---
## RAY:
Not since I took an interest in girls have I been in the choir,
---
## RAY:
because you do get no girls in choirs.
---
## RAY:
Only fat girls and what use are they?
---
## RAY:
No…
--
I go to discos, me.
---
## MAG:
Good enough for yourself.
---
## RAY:
What am I doing standing around here conversing with you?
---
## RAY:
I have left me message and now I am off.
---
## MAG:
Goodbye to you, Ray.
---
## RAY:
Goodbye to you, Missus.
---
## MAG:
And pull the door.
---
## RAY:
I was going to pull the door anyways…!

Oh, did Ray Dooley pass, now?

He passed, aye,

and said hello as he was passing.

There was no visitors, no…

apart from Ray Dooley who passed.

Oh, aye, aye, aye.

Just to say hello he popped his head in?

Aye.

The lies of you.
---
## MAUREEN:
The whole of that Complan you'll drink now,
---
## MAUREEN:
and suck the lumps down too,
---
## MAUREEN:
and whatever's left you haven't drank,
---
## MAUREEN:
it is over your head I will be emptying it,
---
## MAUREEN:
and you know well enough I mean it!
---
## MAUREEN:
Arsing me around, eh?
---
## MAUREEN:
Interfering with my life again?
---
## MAUREEN:
Isn't it enough I've had to be on beck and call for you every day for the past twenty year?
---
## MAUREEN:
Is it one evening out you begrudge me?
---
## MAG:
Young girls should not be out gallivanting with fellas…!
---
## MAUREEN:
Young girls!
---
## MAUREEN:
I'm forty years old, for feck's sake!
---
## MAUREEN:
Finish it!
---
## MAUREEN:
"Young girls"!
---
## MAUREEN:
That's the best yet.
---
## MAUREEN:
And how did Annette or Margo ever get married…
---
## MAUREEN:
if it wasn't first out gallivanting that they were?
---
## MAG:
I don't know.
---
## MAUREEN:
Drink!
---
## MAG:
I don't like it, Maureen.
---
## MAUREEN:
Would you like it better over your head?
---
## MAUREEN:
I'll tell you, eh?
---
## MAUREEN:
"Young girls out gallivanting."
---
## MAUREEN:
I've heard it all now.
---
## MAUREEN:
What have I ever done but *kissed* two men the past forty year?
---
## MAG:
Two men is plenty!
---
## MAUREEN:
Finish!
---
## MAG:
I've finished!
---
---
## MAG:
Two men is two men too much!
---
## MAUREEN:
To you, maybe.
---
## MAUREEN:
To you, not to me.
---
## MAG:
Two men too much!
---
## MAUREEN:
Do you think I like being stuck up here with you?
---
## MAUREEN:
Eh? Like a dried up old—

--
## MAG:
—whore!
---
## MAUREEN: (laughing)
"Whore"?
---
## MAUREEN:
Do I not *wish*, now?
---
## MAUREEN:
Do I not wish?
---
## MAUREEN:
Sometimes I *dream…*
---
## MAG:
Of being a…?
---
## MAUREEN:
Of anything!
---
## MAUREEN: (quietly)
…of anything…
--
other than this.
---
## MAG:
Well, an odd dream that is!
---
## MAUREEN:
It's not at all.
---
## MAUREEN:
Not at all is it an odd dream.
---
## MAUREEN:
And if it is, it's not the only odd dream I do have.
---
## MAUREEN:
Do you want to be hearing another one?
---
## MAG:
I don't.
---
## MAUREEN:
I have a dream sometimes, there,
---
## MAUREEN:
of you dressed all nice and white…
--
in your coffin, there,
---
## MAUREEN:
and me all in black looking in on you,
---
## MAUREEN:
and a fella beside me there, comforting me,
---
## MAUREEN:
the smell of aftershave off him, his arm round me waist.
---
## MAUREEN:
And the fella asks me then if I'll be going for a drink with him at his place after.
---
## MAG:
And what do you say?
---
## MAUREEN:
I say "Aye, what's stopping me now?"
---
## MAG:
You don't!
---
## MAUREEN:
I do!
---
## MAG:
At me funeral?
---
## MAUREEN:
At your bloody wake—sure, is even sooner!
---
## MAG:
Well that's not a nice thing to be dreaming!
---
## MAUREEN:
I know it's not, sure,
---
## MAUREEN:
and it isn't a *dream*-dream at all.
---
## MAUREEN:
It's more of a day-dream.
---
## MAUREEN:
Y’know, something happy to be thinking of…
---
## MAUREEN:
when I'm scraping the skitter out of them hens.
---
## MAG:
Not at all is that a nice dream.
---
## MAG:
That's a mean dream.
---
## MAUREEN:
I don't know if it is or it isn't.
---
## MAUREEN:
I suppose now you'll never be dying.
---
## MAUREEN:
You'll be hanging on forever, just to spite me.
---
## MAG:
I *will* be hanging on forever!
---
## MAUREEN:
I know well you will!
---
## MAG:
Seventy you'll be at my wake,
---
## MAG:
and then how many men'll there be round your waist with their aftershave?
---
## MAUREEN:
None at all, I suppose.
---
## MAG:
None at all is right!
---
## MAUREEN:
Oh aye.
---
## MAUREEN:
Do you want a Kimberley?
---
## MAG:
Have we no shortbread fingers?
---
## MAUREEN:
No, you've ate all the shortbread fingers.
---
## MAUREEN:
Like a pig.
---
## MAG:
I'll have a Kimberley, so, although I don't like 
<br>Kimber­leys.
---
## MAG:
I don't know why you get Kimberleys at all.
---
## MAG:
Kimberleys are horrible.
---
## MAUREEN:
Me world doesn't revolve around your taste in bis­cuits.
---
## MAG:
You'll be going to this do tomorrow, so?
---
## MAUREEN:
I will.
---
## MAUREEN:
It'll be good to see Pato again, any­ways.
---
## MAUREEN:
I didn't even know he was home.
---
## MAG:
But it's all them ol' Yanks will be there tomorrow.
---
## MAUREEN:
So?
---
## MAG:
You said you couldn't stand the Yanks yesterday.
---
## MAG:
The crux of the matter yesterday you said it was.
---
## MAUREEN:
Well, I suppose now, Mother, I will have to be changing me mind,
---
## MAUREEN:
but, sure, isn't that a woman's prerogative?
---
## MAG: (quietly)
It's only prerogatives when it suits you.
---
## MAUREEN:
Don't go using big words you don't understand, now, Mum.
---
## MAG:
This invitation was open to me too, if you'd like to know.
---
## MAUREEN: (half-laughing)
Do you think you'll be coming?
---
## MAG:
I won't, I suppose.
---
## MAUREEN:
You suppose right enough.
---
## MAUREEN:
Lying the head off you, like the baby of a tinker.
---
## MAG:
I was only saying.
---
## MAUREEN:
Well, don't be saying.
---
## MAUREEN:
I think we might take a drive into Westport later, if it doesn't rain.
---
## MAG: (brightly)
Will we take a drive?
---
## MAUREEN:
We could take a little drive for ourselves.
---
## MAG:
We could now.
---
## MAG:
It's a while since we did take a nice drive.
---
## MAG:
We could get some shortbread fingers.
---
## MAUREEN:
Later on, I'm saying.
---
## MAG:
Later on.
---
## MAG:
Not just now.
---
## MAUREEN:
Not just now.
---
## MAUREEN:
Sure, you've only just had your Complan now.
---
## MAUREEN:
Aye, Westport. Aye.
---
## MAUREEN:
And I think I might pick up a nice little dress for meself while I'm there.
---
## MAUREEN:
For the do tomorrow, y'know?

Shh, Pato…

## PATO: (at a reduced volume)
And the Yanks they were within
---
## PATO:
What was it that ol' fella used to say, now?
---
## MAUREEN:
What ol' fella, now?
---
## PATO:
The ol' fella who used to chase ol'…what-you-call.
---
## PATO:
Ol' Bugs Bunny.
---
## MAUREEN:
Would you like a cup of tea, Pato?
---
## PATO:
I would.
---
## MAUREEN:
Except keep your voice down, now.
---
## PATO: (quietly)
I will, I will.
---
## PATO:
I can't remember *what* he used to say.
---
## PATO:
The ol' fella used to chase Bugs Bunny.
---
## PATO:
It was some­thing, now.
---
## MAUREEN:
Look at this.
---
## MAUREEN:
The radio left on too.
---
## MAUREEN:
The daft ol' bitch.
---
## PATO:
Sure, what harm?
---
## PATO:
No, leave it on, now.
---
## PATO:
It'll cover up the sounds.
---
## MAUREEN:
What sounds?
---
## PATO:
The smooching sounds.
---
## MAUREEN:
Will you have a biscuit with your tea?
---
## PATO:
I will.
---
## PATO:
What biscuits do you have, now?
---
## MAUREEN:
Um, only Kimberleys.
---
## PATO:
I'll leave it so, Maureen.
---
## PATO:
I do hate Kimberleys.
---
## PATO:
In fact, I think Kimberleys are the most horrible biscuits in the world.
---
## MAUREEN:
The same as that, I hate Kimberleys.
---
## MAUREEN:
I only get them to torment me mother.
---
## PATO:
I can't see why the Kimberley people go making them at all.
---
## PATO:
Coleman Connor ate a whole pack of Kimberleys one time and he was sick for a week.
---
## PATO:
Or was it Mikados?
---
## PATO:
It was some kind of horrible biscuits.
---
## MAUREEN:
Is it true Coleman cut the ears off Valene's dog and keeps them in his room in a bag?
---
## PATO:
He showed me them ears one day.
---
## MAUREEN:
That's awful spiteful, cutting the ears off a dog.
---
## PATO:
It *is* awful spiteful.
---
## MAUREEN:
It would be spiteful enough to cut the ears off any­body's dog,
---
## MAUREEN:
let alone your own brother's dog.
---
## PATO:
And it had seemed a nice dog.
---
## MAUREEN:
Aye…

aye.
---
---
## PATO:
You feel nice to be giving a squeeze to.
---
## MAUREEN:
Do I?
---
## PATO:
Very nice.
---
## MAUREEN:
Be sitting down for yourself, now, Pato.
---
## PATO:
I will.
---
## PATO:
I do, do what I'm told, I do.
---
## MAUREEN:
Oh-ho, do you now?
---
## MAUREEN:
That's the first time tonight I did notice.
---
## MAUREEN:
Them stray ol' hands of yours.
---
## PATO:
Sure, I have no control over me hands.
---
## PATO:
They have a mind of their own.
---
## PATO:
Except I didn't notice you complaining over much anyways, me stray ol' hands.
---
## PATO:
Not too many complaints at all!
---
## MAUREEN:
I had complaints when they were straying over that Yank girl earlier on in the evening.
---
## PATO:
Well, I hadn't noticed you there at that time, Maureen.
---
## PATO:
How was I to know the beauty queen of Leenane was still yet to arrive?
---
## MAUREEN:
"The beauty queen of Leenane."
---
## MAUREEN:
Get away with ya!
---
## PATO:
Is true!
---
## MAUREEN:
Why so have no more than two words passed between us the past twenty years?
---
## PATO:
Sure, it's took me all this time to get up the courage.
---
## MAUREEN:
Ah, bollocks to ya!
---
## PATO:
I don't know, Maureen.
---
## PATO:
I don't know.
---
## MAUREEN:
Don't know what?
---
## PATO:
Why I never got around to really speaking to you or asking you out or the like.
---
## PATO:
I don't know.
---
## PATO:
Of course, hop­ping across to that bastarding ol' place every couple of months couldn’t have helped.
---
## MAUREEN:
England? Aye.
---
## MAUREEN:
Do you not like it there, so?
---
## PATO:
It's money.
---
## PATO:
And it's Tuesday I'll be back there again.
---
## MAUREEN:
Tuesday? This Tuesday?
---
## PATO:
Aye. 
--
It was only to see the Yanks off I was over.
---
## PATO:
To say hello and say goodbye.
---
## PATO:
No time back at all.
---
## MAUREEN:
That's Ireland, anyways.
---
## MAUREEN:
There's always someone leaving.
---
## PATO:
It's always the way.
---
## MAUREEN:
Bad, too.
---
## PATO:
What can you do?
---
## MAUREEN:
Stay?
---
## PATO:
I do ask meself, if there was good work in Leenane, would I stay in Leenane?
---
## PATO:
I mean, there never will be good work, but hypothetically, I'm saying.
---
## PATO:
Or even bad work.
---
## PATO:
Any work.
---
## PATO:
And when I'm over there in London and working in rain,
---
## PATO:
and it's more or less cattle I am,
---
## PATO:
and the young fellas cursing over cards and drunk and sick,
---
## PATO:
and the ol' digs over there,
---
## PATO:
all pee-stained mattresses and nothing to do but watch the clock…
---
## PATO:
When it's there I am, it's here I wish I was, of course.
---
## PATO:
Who wouldn't?
---
## PATO:
But when it's here I am…
---
## PATO:
It isn't there I want to be, of course not.
---
## PATO:
But I know it isn't here I want to be either.
---
## MAUREEN:
And why, Pato?
---
## PATO:
I can't put my finger on why.
---
## PATO:
Of course it's beautiful here, a fool can see.
---
## PATO:
The mountains and the green, and people speak.
---
## PATO:
But when everybody knows everybody else's business…
---
## PATO:
I don't know.
---
## PATO:
You can't kick a cow in Leenane…
---
## PATO:
without some bastard holding a grudge twenty year.
---
## MAUREEN:
It's true enough.
---
## PATO:
It is.
---
## PATO:
In England they don't care if you live or die,
---
## PATO:
and it's funny but that isn't altogether a bad thing.
---
## PATO:
Ah, sometimes it is…
---
## PATO:
Ah, I don't know.
---
## MAUREEN:
Do you think you'll ever settle down in the one place, so, Pato?
---
## MAUREEN:
When you get married, I suppose.
---
## PATO: (half-laughing)
"When I get married…"
---
## MAUREEN:
You will someday, I'll bet you get married.
---
## MAUREEN:
Wouldn't you want to?
---
## PATO:
I can't say it's something I do worry me head over.
---
## MAUREEN:
Of course, the rake of women you have stashed all over, you wouldn't need to.
---
## PATO:
I have no rake of women.
---
## MAUREEN:
You have one or two, I bet.
---
## PATO:
I may have one or two.
---
## PATO:
That I know to say hello to, now.

## MAUREEN:
"Hello" me—

She does have a creepy ol' voice.

Always scared me, this song did when I was a lad.

She's like a ghoul singing.

Does the grandmother die at the end, now, or is she just sleeping?

## MAUREEN:
Just sleeping, I think she is.

Aye…

While the two go hand in hand through the fields.

Aye.

Didn't we send them on their way well?

We did, we did.

Not a dry eye.

## MAUREEN:
Indeed.
---
## PATO:
Eh?

Indeed.

## PATO:
Aye. That we did.

That we did.

## MAUREEN:
So who *was* the Yankee girl you did have your hands all over?

Oh, will you stop it with your "hands all over"?!
---
## PATO:
Barely touched her, I did.

## MAUREEN:
Oh-ho!

A second cousin of me uncle, I think she is.

Dolores somebody.

## PATO:
Healey or Hooley.

## PATO:
Healey.

## PATO:
Boston, too, she lives.

## MAUREEN:
That was illegal, so, if it's your second cousin she is.
---
## PATO:
Illegal me arse, and it's not *my* second cousin she is anyway…
---
## PATO:
And what's so illegal?
---
## PATO:
Your second cousin's boobs aren't out of bounds, are they?

## MAUREEN:
They are!

I don't know about that.

I'll have to consult with me lawyer on that one.

I may get arrested the next time.

And I have a defense anyways.

Well, I won't be getting me own porridge, I'll tell you that now.

I'd be afraid.

You won't catch me getting me own porridge.

I was all for creeping out before ever you got yourself up,

"What harm?"

I suppose we are, but…I don't know.

It's still awkward, now, or something.

D'you know what I mean?

God willing anyways. Aye.

## PATO:
Aye.

Was it a mug of Complan, too, you wanted?

It was.

## PATO:
You like your Complan, so.
---
## MAG:
I don't.
---
## PATO:
Do you not, now?

## MAG:
She makes me drink it when I don't like it and forces me.

But Complan's good for you anyways if you're old.
---
## MAG:
I suppose it's good for me.
---
## PATO:
It is.

Isn't it chicken flavor?

I don't know what flavor.

Aye, it's chicken flavor.

That's the best flavor.

Was it a scald you did get?

Uh-huh…

We was careful, weren't we, Pato?

---
## MAUREEN:
A mighty ol' taste.
---
## MAUREEN:
Uh-huh.
---
## PATO:
Um, I'll have to be off now in a minute anyways.
---
## PATO:
I do have packing to do, I do, and what-you-call…
---
## MAG: (loudly)
*She's* the one that scalded me hand!
---
## MAG:
I'll tell you that, now!
---
## MAG:
Let alone sitting on stray men!
---
## MAG:
Held it down on the range she did!
---
## MAG:
Poured chip pan fat o'er it!
---
## MAG:
Aye, and told the doctor it was me!
---
## MAUREEN: (nonplussed)
Be having a mug of tea before you go, Pato, now.
---
## PATO:
Maybe a quick one.
---
## MAG:
Did you not hear what I said?
---
## MAUREEN:
Do you think Pato listens to the mutterings of a senile ol' hen?
---
## MAG:
Senile, is it?
---
## MAG:
Don't I have the evidence?
---
## MAUREEN:
Come over here a second, Pato.
---
## MAUREEN:
I want you to smell this sink for me.
---
## MAG:
Sinks have nothing to do with it!
---
## MAUREEN:
Come over here now, Pato.
---
## PATO:
Eh?
---
## MAUREEN:
Smell that sink.
---
template: noise
[sniff]
---
## MAG:
Nothing to do with it, sinks have!
---
## MAUREEN:
Nothing to do with it, is it?
---
## MAUREEN:
Everything to do with it, I think it has.
---
## MAUREEN:
Serves as evidence to the character of me accuser, it does.
---
## PATO:
What is that, now, the drains?
---
## MAUREEN:
Not the drains at all…
--
not the drains at all.
---
## MAUREEN:
Doesn't she pour a potty of wee away down there every morning,
---
## MAUREEN:
though I tell her 700 times the lavvy to use, but oh no.
---
## MAG:
Me scalded hand this conversation was…?
---
## MAG:
And not wee at all?
---
## MAUREEN:
And doesn't even rinse it either.
---
## MAUREEN:
Now is that hygienic?
---
## MAUREEN:
And she does have a urine infection, too…
---
## MAUREEN:
is even less hygienic.
---
## MAUREEN:
I wash me praities in there.
---
## MAUREEN:
Here's your tea now, Pato.
---
## MAG:
Put some clothes on you, going around the house half­-naked!
---
## MAG:
Would be more in your line!
---
## MAUREEN:
I do like going around the house half-naked.
---
## MAUREEN:
It does turn me on, it does.
---
## MAG:
I suppose it does, aye.
---
## MAUREEN:
It does.
---
## MAG:
And reminds you of Difford Hall in England, too, I'll bet it does…
---
## MAUREEN: (angrily)
Now you just shut your fecking…
---
## MAG:
None of your own clothes they let you wear in there either, did they?
---
## MAUREEN:
Shut your ol' gob, I said…!
---
## MAG:
Only long ol' gowns and buckle-down jackets…
---
## PATO:
What's the matter with ye two at all, now…?
---
## MAG:
Difford Hall! Difford Hall! Difford Hall…!
---
## MAUREEN:
Difford Hall, uh-huh, and I suppose…
---
## MAG:
Difford Hall! Difford Hall…!
---
## MAUREEN:
And I suppose that potty of wee was just a figment of me imagination?
---
## MAG:
Forget wee! Forget wee!
---
## MAG:
D'you want to know what Dif­ford Hall is, fella?
---
## MAUREEN:
Shut up, now!
---
## MAG:
It's a nuthouse!
---
## MAG:
An ol' nuthouse in England I did have to sign her out of
---
## MAG:
and promise to keep her in me care.
---
## MAG:
Would you want to be seeing the papers now?
---
## MAG:
As proof, like.
---
## MAG:
Or to prove am I just a senile ol' hen, like,
---
## MAG:
or *who’s* the loopy one?
---
## MAG:
Heh! Pegging wee in me face, oh aye…
---
## MAUREEN: (quietly)
It's true I was in a home there a while, now, after a bit of a breakdown I had.
---
## MAUREEN:
Years ago this is.
---
## PATO:
What harm a breakdown, sure?
---
## PATO:
Lots of people do have breakdowns.
---
## MAUREEN:
A lot of doolally people, aye.
---
## PATO:
Not doolally people at all.
---
## PATO:
A lot of well-educated people have breakdowns too.
---
## PATO:
In fact, it you're well-educated it's even more likely.
---
## PATO:
Poor Spike Milligan, isn't he forever having break­downs?
---
## PATO:
He hardly stops.
---
## PATO:
I do have trouble with me nerves every now and then, too,
---
## PATO:
I don't mind admitting.
---
## PATO:
There's no shame at all in that.
---
## PATO:
Only means you do think about things, and take them to heart.
---
## MAUREEN:
No shame in being put in a nuthouse a month?
---
## MAUREEN:
Ah no.
---
## PATO:
No shame in thinking about things and worrying about things, I'm saying,
---
## PATO:
and “nuthouse” is a silly word to be using,
---
## PATO:
and you know that well enough, now, Maureen.
---
## MAUREEN:
I do.
---
## MAUREEN:
In England I was, this happened.
---
## MAUREEN:
Cleaning work.
---
## MAUREEN:
When I was twenty-five.
---
## MAUREEN:
Me first time ever.
---
## MAUREEN:
Me only time over.
---
## MAUREEN:
Me sister had just got married, me other sister just about to.
---
## MAUREEN:
Over in Leeds I was, cleaning offices.
---
## MAUREEN:
Bogs.
---
## MAUREEN:
A whole group of us, only them were all English.
---
## MAUREEN:
"Ya ol' backward Paddy fecking…"
---
## MAUREEN:
"The fecking pig's­ backside face on ya."
---
## MAUREEN:
The first time out of Connemara this was I'd been.
---
## MAUREEN:
"Get back to that backward fecking pigsty of yours or whatever hole it was you drug yourself out of."
---
## MAUREEN:
Half of the swearing I didn't even understand.
---
## MAUREEN:
I had to have a black woman explain it to me.
---
## MAUREEN:
Trinidad she was from.
---
## MAUREEN:
They'd have a go at her too, but she'd just laugh.
---
## MAUREEN:
This big face she had, this big ol' smile.
---
## MAUREEN:
And photos of Trinidad she'd show me,
---
## MAUREEN:
and "What the hell have you left there for?" I'd say.
---
## MAUREEN:
"To come to this place, cleaning shite?"
---
## MAUREEN:
And a calendar with a picture of Connemara on I showed her one day,
---
## MAUREEN:
and "What the hell have you left there for?" she said back to me.
---
## MAUREEN:
"To come to this place…"
---
## MAUREEN:
But she moved to London then.
---
## MAUREEN:
Her husband was dying.
---
## MAUREEN:
And after that it all just got to me.
---
## PATO:
That's all past and behind you now anyways, Maureen.
---
---
## MAUREEN:
Am I still a nutcase you're saying, or you're won­dering?
---
## PATO:
Not at all, now…
---
## MAUREEN:
Oh no…?
---
## PATO:
Not at all.
---
## PATO:
That's a long time in the past is all I'm saying.
---
## PATO:
And nothing to be ashamed of.
---
## PATO:
Put it behind you, you should.
---
## MAUREEN:
Put it behind me, aye,
---
## MAUREEN:
with that one hovering, eyeing me every minute like I'm some kind of…
---
## MAUREEN:
some kind of…
---
## MAUREEN:
And, no, I didn't scald her ol' hand, no matter how doolally I ever was.
---
## MAUREEN:
Trying to cook chips on her own, she was.
---
## MAUREEN:
We'd argued, and I'd left her on her own an hour,
---
## MAUREEN:
and chips she up and decided she wanted.
---
## MAUREEN:
She must've tipped the pan over.
---
## MAUREEN:
God knows how, the *eej*.
---
## MAUREEN:
I just found her lying there.
---
## MAUREEN:
Only, because of Difford Hall,
---
## MAUREEN:
she thinks any accusation she throws at me I won't be any the wiser.
---
## MAUREEN:
I won't be able to tell the differ, what's true and what's not.
---
## MAUREEN:
Well, I *am* able to tell the differ.
---
## MAUREEN:
Well able, the smelly ol' bitch.
---
## PATO:
You shouldn't let her get to you, Maureen.
---
## MAUREEN:
How can I help it, Pato?
---
## MAUREEN:
She's enough to drive anyone loopy,
---
## MAUREEN:
if they weren't loopy to begin with.
---
## PATO:
She is at that, I suppose.
---
## MAUREEN:
She is.
---
## MAUREEN:
It's surprised I am how sane I've turned out!
---
## PATO:
I *will* have to be off in a minute now, Maureen.
---
## MAUREEN:
Okay, Pato.
---
## MAUREEN:
Did you finish your tea, now?
---
## PATO:
I didn't.
---
## PATO:
The talk of your mother's wee…
---
## PATO:
It did put me off it.
---
## MAUREEN:
It would.
---
## MAUREEN:
It would anybody.
---
## MAUREEN:
Don't I have to live with it?
---
## MAUREEN: (sadly)
…Don't I have to live with it?
---
## MAUREEN:
I suppose I do, now.
---
## PATO:
Be putting on some clothes there, Maureen.
---
## PATO:
You'll freeze with no fire down.
---
---
## MAUREEN: (quietly)
"Be putting on some clothes"?
---
## MAUREEN:
Is it ugly you think I am now, so, "Be putting on some clothes…"
---
## PATO:
No, Maureen, the cold, I'm saying.
---
## PATO:
You can't go walking about…
---
## PATO:
You'II freeze, sure.
---
## MAUREEN:
It wasn't ugly you thought I was last night,
---
## MAUREEN:
or maybe it was, now.
---
## PATO:
No, Maureen, now, what…?
---
## MAUREEN:
A beauty queen you thought I was last night,
---
## MAUREEN:
or you said I was.
---
## MAUREEN:
When it's "Cover yourself," now,
---
## MAUREEN:
"You do sicken me"…
---
## PATO:
Maureen, no, now, what are you saying that for…?
---
## MAUREEN:
Maybe that was the reason, so.
---
## PATO:
The reason what?
---
## MAUREEN:
Be off with you, so, if I sicken you.
---
## PATO:
You don't sicken me.
---
## MAUREEN: (choking back tears)
Be off with you, I said.
---
## PATO:
Maureen…
---
## MAG:
Eh? Here's the papers now, Difford Hall,
---
## MAG:
if I'm such a senile ol' hen, eh?
---
## MAG:
Who wants an ol' read, now? Eh?
---
## MAG:
Proof this is, let alone pegging sinks at me! Eh?
---
## PATO:
Maureen…
---
## MAUREEN: (gently)
Be going now, Pato.
---
## PATO:
I'll write to you from England.
---
## PATO:
(sternly)
Look at me!
---
## PATO:
(softly)
I'll write to you from England.
---
template: noise
[footsteps receding]
---
## MAG:
He won't write at all.
---
## MAG:
And I did throw your ol' dress in that dirty corner too!
---
## MAUREEN:
Why? Why? Why do you…?
---
## MAUREEN:
Just look at yourself.
---
## MAG:
Just look at *your*self, too, would be…
---
## MAG:
would be…
---
## MAG:
…more in your line.
---
## MAG: (quietly)
Me porridge is gone cold now.

Me porridge is gone cold now!

INTERMISSION
---
---
## PATO:
Dear Maureen, it is Pato Dooly and I'm writing from London,
---
## PATO:
and I'm sorry it's taken so long to write to you,
---
## PATO:
but to be honest I didn't know whether you wanted me to one way or the other,
---
## PATO:
so I have taken it upon myself to try and see.
---
## PATO:
There are a lot of things I want to say, but I am no letter-writer,
---
## PATO:
but I will try to say them if I can.
---
## PATO:
Well, Maureen, there is no major news here,
---
## PATO:
except a Wexford man on the site a day ago,
---
## PATO:
a rake of bricks fell on him from the scaffold
---
## PATO:
and forty stitches he did have in his head and was lucky to be alive at all.
---
## PATO:
He was an old fella, or fifty-odd anyways,
---
## PATO:
but apart from that there is no major news.
---
## PATO:
I do go out for a pint of a Saturday or a Friday,
---
## PATO:
but I don't know nobody and don't speak to anyone.
---
## PATO:
There is no one to speak to.
---
## PATO:
The gangerman does pop his head in sometimes.
---
## PATO:
I don't know if I've spelt it right,
---
## PATO:
'Gangerman', is it 'e-r' or is it 'a'?
---
## PATO:
It is not a word we was taught in school.
---
## PATO:
Well, Maureen, I am "beating around the bush," as they say,
---
## PATO:
because it is you and me I do want to be talking about,
---
## PATO:
if there is such a thing now as "you and me,"
---
## PATO:
I don't know the state of play.
---
## PATO:
What I thought I thought we were getting on royally at the goodbye to the Yanks
---
## PATO:
and the part after when we did talk and went to yours.
---
## PATO:
And I did think you were a beauty queen
---
## PATO:
and I do think, and it wasn't any­ thing to do with that at all or with you at all,
---
## PATO:
I think you thought it was.
---
## PATO:
All it was, it has happened to me a couple of times before when I've had a drink taken
---
## PATO:
and was nothing to do with did I want to.
---
## PATO:
I would have been honored to be the first one you chose, and flattered,
---
## PATO:
and the thing that I'm saying,
---
## PATO:
I was hon­ored then and I am still honored,
---
## PATO:
and just because it was not to be that night,
---
## PATO:
does it mean it is not to be ever?
---
## PATO:
I don't see why it should, and I don't see why you was so angry
---
## PATO:
when you was so nice to me when it happened.
---
## PATO:
I think you thought I looked at you differently when your breakdown business came up,
---
## PATO:
when I didn't look at you differently at all,
---
## PATO:
or the thing I said "Put on your clothes, it's cold,"
---
## PATO:
when you seemed to think I did not want to be looking at you in your bra and slip there,
---
## PATO:
when nothing could be further from the truth,
---
## PATO:
because if truth be told,
---
## PATO:
I could have looked at you in your bra and slip until the cows came home.
---
## PATO:
I could never get my fill of looking at you in your bra and slip,
---
## PATO:
and some day, God-willing,
---
## PATO:
I will be looking at you in your bra and slip again.
---
## PATO:
Which leads me on to my other thing,
---
## PATO:
unless you still haven't forgiven me,
---
## PATO:
in which case we should just forget about it and part as friends,
---
## PATO:
but if you have forgiven me it leads me on to my other thing
---
## PATO:
which I was lying to you before when I said I had no news
---
## PATO:
because I do have news.
---
## PATO:
What the news is I have been in touch with me uncle in Boston
---
## PATO:
and the incident with the Wexford man with the bricks was just the final straw.
---
## PATO:
You'd be lucky to get away with your life building sites in England,
---
## PATO:
let alone the bad money and the "You ol' Irish this­-and-that,"
---
## PATO:
and I have been in touch with me uncle in Boston
---
## PATO:
and a job he has offered me there,
---
## PATO:
and I am going to take him up on it.
---
## PATO:
Back in Leenane two weeks tomorrow I'll be,
---
## PATO:
to collect up my stuff and I suppose a bit of a do they'll throw me,
---
## PATO:
and the thing I want to say to you is…
---
## PATO:
do you want to come with me?
---
## PATO:
Not straight away of course, I know,
---
## PATO:
because you would have things to clear up,
---
## PATO:
but after a month or two I'm saying,
---
## PATO:
but maybe you haven't forgiven me at all and it's being a fool I'm being.
---
## PATO:
Well, if you haven't forgiven me,
---
## PATO:
I suppose it'd be best if we just kept out of each other's way the few days I'm over,
---
## PATO:
and if I don't hear from you I will understand,
---
## PATO:
but if you have forgiven me, what's to keep you in Ireland?
---
## PATO:
There's your sisters could take care of your mother
---
## PATO:
and why should you have had the burden all these years?
---
## PATO:
Don't you deserve a life?
---
## PATO:
And if they say no, isn't there the home in Oughterard?
---
## PATO:
Isn't ideal but they do take good care of them,
---
## PATO:
my mother before she passed,
---
## PATO:
and don't they have bingo
---
## PATO:
and what good to your mother does that big hill do?
---
## PATO:
No good.
---
## PATO:
Anyways, Maureen, I will leave it up to you.
---
## PATO:
My address is up the top there and the number of the phone in the hall,
---
## PATO:
only let it ring a good while if you want to ring and you'll need the codes,
---
## PATO:
and it would be grand to hear from you.
---
## PATO:
If I don't hear from you, I will understand.
---
## PATO:
Take good care of yourself, Maureen.
---
## PATO:
And that night we shared,
---
## PATO:
even if nothing happened,
---
## PATO:
it still makes me happy just to think about it,
---
## PATO:
being close to you,
---
## PATO:
and even if I never hear from you again,
---
## PATO:
I'll always have a happy memory of that night,
---
## PATO:
and that's all I wanted to say to you.
---
## PATO:
Do think about it.
---
## PATO:
Yours sincerely, Pato Dooley.
---
---
## PATO:
Dear Raymond, how are you?
---
## PATO:
I'm enclosing a bunch of letters I don't want different people snooping in on.
---
## PATO:
Will you hand them out for me and don't be reading them, I know you won't be.
---
## PATO:
The one to Mick Dowd you can wait till he comes out of hos­pital.
---
## PATO:
Let me know how he is or have they arrested the lass who belted him.
---
## PATO:
The one to poor girleen you can give to her any time you see her,
---
## PATO:
it is only to tell her to stop falling in love with priests.
---
## PATO:
But the one to Maureen Folan,
---
## PATO:
I want you to go over there the day you get this and put it in her hand.
---
## PATO:
This is impor­tant now…
---
## PATO:
In her hand put it.
---
## PATO:
Not much other news here.
---
## PATO:
I'll fill you in on more of the America details nearer the time.
---
## PATO:
Yes, it's a great thing.
---
## PATO:
Good luck to you, Raymond.
---
## PATO:
And P.S. …
---
## PATO:
Remember now…
--
in Maureen's hand put it.
---
## PATO:
Goodbye.

You said she'd be home be now, didn't you?

I did.

Maybe she got talking to somebody,

although she doesn't usually get talking to somebody.

She does keep herself to herself.
---
## RAY:
I know well she does keep herself to herself.
---
## RAY:
Loopy that woman is, if you ask me.
---
## RAY:
Didn't she keep the tennis ball that came off me and Mairtin Hanlon 's swingball set
---
## RAY:
and landed in yer fields and wouldn't give it back no matter how much we begged
---
## RAY:
and that was ten years ago and I still haven't forgotten it?

I do have no comment, as they say.

Still haven't forgotten it and I never will forget it!

But wasn't it that you and Mairtin were pegging yer tennis ball at our chickens

It was swingball we were playing, Missus!

Oh…

Not clobbering at all.

Swingball it was.

And never again able to play swingball were we.

No use.

No use is right!

No use at all.

Didn't even look up.
---
## MAG:
Didn't she?
---
## RAY:
And what I thought of saying,
---
## RAY:
I thought of saying, "Up your ol' hole, Missus,"
---
## RAY:
but I didn't say it, I just thought of saying it,
---
## RAY:
but thinking back on it I should've gone ahead and said it and skitter on the bitch!
---
## MAG:
It would've been good enough for her to say it,
---
## MAG:
up and ignoring you on the road,
---
## MAG:
because you're a good *gasur*, Ray, fixing me fire for me.
---
## MAG:
Ah, she's been in a foul ol' mood lately.
---
## RAY:
She does wear horrible clothes.
---
## RAY:
And everyone agrees.
---
## RAY:
“May you be half an hour in Heaven afore the Devil knows you're dead.”
---
## MAG:
Aye.
---
## RAY: (silly voice)
*“May you be half an hour in Heaven afore the Devil knows you're dead.”*
---
## MAG: (laughing politely)
Aye.
---
## RAY:
This is a great ol' poker, this is.
---
## MAG:
Is it?
---
## RAY:
Good and heavy.
---
## MAG:
Heavy and long.
---
## RAY:
Good and heavy and long.
---
## RAY:
A half a dozen coppers you could take out with this poker
---
## RAY:
and barely notice and have not a scratch on it
---
## RAY:
and then clobber them again just for the fun of seeing the blood running out of them.
---
## RAY:
Will you sell it to me?
---
## MAG:
I will not.
---
## MAG:
To go battering the police?
---
## RAY:
A fiver.
---
## MAG:
We do need it for the fire, sure.
---
## RAY:
Sure, that poker's just going to waste in this house.
---
## RAY:
Ah, I could get a dozen pokers in town just as good if I wanted,
---
## RAY:
and at half the price.
---
---
## RAY: (sighing)
A whole afternoon I'm wasting here.
---
## RAY:
When I could be at home watching telly.
---
## MAG:
You never know, it might be evening before she's ever home.
---
## RAY: (angrily)
You said three o'clock it was sure to be when I first came in!
---
## MAG:
Aye, three o'clock it usually is, oh aye.
---
## MAG:
Just some­ times it does be evening.
---
## MAG:
On occasion, like.
---
## MAG:
Sometimes it does be *late* evening.
---
## MAG:
Sometimes it does be *night*.
---
## MAG:
*Morning* it was one time before she…
---
## RAY: (interrupting angrily)
All right, all right!
---
## RAY:
It's thumping you in a minute I'll be!
---
## MAG:
I'm only saying now.
---
## RAY:
Well, stop saying!
---
## RAY:
This house does smell of pee, this house does.
---
## MAG: (embarrassed)
Um, cats do get in.
---
## RAY:
Do cats get in?
---
## MAG:
They do…
---
## MAG:
They do go to the sink.
---
## RAY:
What do they go to the sink for?
---
## MAG:
To wee.
---
## RAY:
To wee?
---
## RAY:
They go to the sink to wee?
---
## RAY: (sarcastically)
Sure, that's mighty good of them.
---
## RAY:
You do get a very considerate breed of cat up this way, so.
---
## MAG:
I don't know what breed they are.

*…I don't want to be here, I don't want to be here…*
---
## MAG:
Do me a mug of tea, Ray.
---
## MAG:
Or a mug of Complan do me, even.
---
## MAG:
And give it a good stir to get rid of the ol' lumps.
---
## RAY:
If it was getting rid of ol' lumps I was to be,
---
## RAY:
it wouldn't be with Complan I'd be starting.
---
## RAY:
It would be much closer to home, boy.
---
## RAY:
Oh aye, much closer.
---
## RAY:
A big lump sitting in an ol' fecking rocking-chair it would be.
---
## RAY:
I'll tell you that!

## MAG:
Or a Cup-a-Soup do me.

---
## RAY: (resigned)
Pato, Pato, Pato.
---
## RAY:
Ah what news could it be?
---
## RAY: (sternly)
Were I to leave this letter here with you, Missus,
---
## RAY: (sternly)
it would be straight to that one you would be giving it, isn't that right?
---
## MAG:
It is.
---
## MAG:
Oh, straight to Maureen I'd be giving it.
---
## RAY:
And it isn't opening it you would be?
---
## MAG:
It is not.
---
## MAG:
Sure, a letter is a private thing.
---
## MAG:
If it isn't my name on it, what business would it be of mine?
---
## RAY:
And may God strike you dead if you do open it?
---
## MAG:
And may God strike me dead if I do open it,
---
## MAG:
only He'll have no need to strike me dead because I won't be opening it.
---
## RAY:
I'll leave it, so.
---
---
## RAY:
I'll be seeing you then, Missus.
---
## MAG:
Be seeing you, Pato—
---
## MAG:
Be seeing you, ~~Pato~~—*Ray*, I mean.

Can I help it if it's a poor reception?

Crackly.

We can hardly hear the tunes.

We can hardly hear what are the dedications or from what part of the country.

I can hear well enough.

Can ya?

Maybe it's deaf it is you're going.

## MAG:
It's not deaf I'm going.
---
## MAG:
Not nearly deaf.
---
## MAUREEN:
It's a home for deaf people I'll have to be putting you in soon.
---
## MAUREEN:
And it isn't cod in butter sauce you'll be getting in there.
---
## MAUREEN:
No. Not by a long chalk.
---
## MAUREEN:
Ol' beans on toast or something is all you'll be getting in there.
---
## MAUREEN:
If you're lucky.

## MAUREEN:
And then if you don't eat it,

## MAUREEN:
they'll give you a good kick, or maybe a punch.
---
## MAG:
I'd die before I'd let meself be put in a home.
---
## MAUREEN:
Hopefully, aye.
---
## MAG:
That was a nice bit of cod in butter sauce, Mau­reen.
---
## MAUREEN:
I suppose it was.
---
## MAG:
Tasty.
---
## MAUREEN:
All I do is boil it in the bag and snip it with a scissor.
---
## MAUREEN:
I hardly need your compliments.

## MAG:
Mean to me is all you ever are nowadays.

## MAUREEN:
If I am or if I'm not.

## MAUREEN:
Didn't I buy you a packet of wine gums last week if I'm so mean?

## MAG:
All because of Pato Dooley you're mean, I sup­pose.
---
## MAG:
Him not inviting you to his ol' going-away do tonight.
---
## MAUREEN:
Pato Dooley has his own life to lead.
---
## MAG:
Only after one thing that man was.
---
## MAUREEN:
Maybe he was, now.
---
## MAUREEN:
Or maybe it was me who was only after one thing.
---
## MAUREEN:
We do have equality nowadays.
---
## MAUREEN:
Not like in your day.
---
## MAG:
There was nothing wrong in my day.
---
## MAUREEN:
Allowed to go on top of a man nowadays, we are.
---
## MAUREEN:
All we have to do is ask.
---
## MAUREEN:
And nice it is on top of a man, too.
---
## MAG:
Is it nice now, Maureen?
---
## MAUREEN: (bemused)
It is.
---
## MAG:
It does sound nice.
---
## MAG:
Ah, good enough for yourself, now.
---
## MAG:
And not worried about having been put in the family way, are you?
---
## MAUREEN:
I'm not…we was careful.
---
## MAG:
Was ye careful?
---
## MAUREEN:
Aye. We was nice and careful.
---
## MAUREEN:
We was *lovely* and careful, if you must know.
---
## MAG:
I'll bet ye was lovely and careful, aye.
---
## MAG:
Oh aye, lovely and careful, I'll bet ye were.
---
## MAUREEN:
You haven't been sniffing the paraffin lamps again?
---
## MAG:
It's always the paraffin lamp business you do throw at me.
---
## MAUREEN:
It's a funny ol' mood you're in, so.
---
## MAG:
Is it a funny ol' mood?
---
## MAG:
No…just a normal mood, now.
---
## MAUREEN:
It's a funny one.
---
## MAUREEN:
Aye, a great ol' time me and Pato did have.
---
## MAUREEN:
I can see now what all the fuss did be about,
---
## MAUREEN:
but ah, there has to be more to a man than just being good in bed.
---
## MAUREEN:
Things in common too you do have to have, y'know,
---
## MAUREEN:
like what books do you be reading, or what are your politics and the like,
---
## MAUREEN:
so I did have to tell him it was no-go,
---
## MAUREEN:
no matter how good in bed he was.
---
## MAG:
When was this you did tell him?
---
## MAUREEN:
A while ago it was I did tell him, back—
---
## MAG: (interrupting)
And I suppose he was upset at that.
---
## MAUREEN:
He *was* upset at that but I assured him it was for the best,
---
## MAUREEN:
and he did seem to accept it then.
---
## MAG:
I'll bet he accepted it.
---
## MAUREEN:
But that's why I thought it would be unfair of me
---
## MAUREEN:
to go over to his do and wish him goodbye.
---
## MAUREEN:
I thought it would be awkward for him.
---
## MAG:
It would be awkward for him, aye, I suppose.
---
## MAG:
Oh aye.
---
## MAG:
So all it was was ye didn't have enough things in common was all that parted ye?
---
## MAUREEN:
Is all it was.
---
## MAUREEN:
And parted on amicable terms, and with no grudges on either side.
---
## MAUREEN:
No. No grudges at all.
---
## MAUREEN:
I did get what I did want out of Pato Dooley that night,
---
## MAUREEN:
and that was good enough for him,
---
## MAUREEN:
and that was good enough for me.
---
## MAG:
Oh aye, now, I'm sure.
---
## MAG:
It was good enough for the both of ye, oh aye.
---
## MAUREEN: (laughing)
It's a crazy ol' mood you're in for yourself tonight!
---
## MAUREEN:
Pleased that tonight it is Pato's leaving
---
## MAUREEN:
and won't be corning pawing me again is what it is, I bet.
---
## MAG:
Maybe that's what it is.
---
## MAG:
I *am* glad Pato's leaving.
---
## MAUREEN:
An interfering ol' biddy is all you are.
---
## MAUREEN:
Do you want a shortbread finger?
---
## MAG:
I do want a shortbread finger.
---
## MAUREEN:
…Please.
---
## MAG:
Please.
---
## MAUREEN:
Remind me of something, shortbread fingers do.
---
## MAG:
I suppose they do, now.
---
## MAUREEN:
I suppose it's so long since you've seen what they remind me of,
---
## MAUREEN:
you do forget what they look like.
---
## MAG:
I suppose I do.
---
## MAG:
And I suppose you're the expert.
---
## MAUREEN:
I am the expert.
---
## MAG:
Oh aye.
---
## MAUREEN:
I'm the king of the experts.
---
## MAG:
I suppose you are, now.
---
## MAG:
Oh, I'm sure.
---
## MAG:
I suppose you're the king of the experts.
---
## MAUREEN: (suspicious)
Why wouldn't you be sure?
---
## MAG:
With your Pato Dooley and your throwing it all in me face like an ol' peahen, when…
---

## MAUREEN:
When what?

Not another word on the subject am I saying.

I do have no comment, as they say.
---
## MAG:
This is a nice shortbread finger.
---
## MAUREEN: (sharply)
When what, now?
---
## MAG: (nervousy)
When nothing, Maureen.
---
## MAUREEN: (forcefully)
No, when what, now?
---
## MAUREEN:
Have you been speaking to somebody?
---
## MAG:
Who would I be speaking to, Maureen?
---
## MAUREEN:
You've been speaking to somebody…you've…
---
## MAG:
Nobody have I been speaking to, Maureen.
---
## MAG:
You know well I don't be speaking to anybody.
---
## MAG:
And, sure, who would Pato be telling about that…?
---
---
## MAUREEN:
How do you know?
---
## MAG:
Nothing do I know, Maureen.
---
## MAUREEN:
Uh-huh?
---
## MAG:
Or was it Ray did mention something?
---
## MAG:
Aye, I think it was Ray…
---
## MAUREEN:
Nothing to Ray would Pato've said about that sub­ject.
---
## MAG: (tearfully)
Just to stop you bragging like an ol' peahen, was I saying, Maureen…
---
## MAG: (tearfully)
Sure what does an ol' woman like me know?
---
## MAG: (tearfully)
Just guessing, I was.
---
## MAUREEN:
You know sure enough.
---
## MAUREEN:
And guessing me arse.
---
## MAUREEN:
And not on me face was it written.
---
## MAUREEN:
For the second time and for the last time I'll be asking, now.
---
## MAUREEN:
How do you know?
---
## MAG:
On your face it *was* written, Maureen.
---
## MAG:
Sure that's he only way I knew.

You still do have the look of a virgin about you, you always have had.

## MAUREEN:
And what else did it say?
---
## MAG:
He won't be putting me into no home!
---
## MAUREEN:
What are you talking about, no home?
---
## MAUREEN:
What else did it say?!

I can't remember, now, Maureen, I *can't*…!

No…!

But how could you go with him?

You do still have me to look after.

Isn't that where them two were from, the Kennedys?

Or was that some­where else, now?

Robert Kennedy I did prefer over Jack Kennedy.

He seemed to be nicer to women.

Although I haven't read up on it.

Boston…

it does have a nice ring to it.

Better than England it'll be, I'm sure.

Although where wouldn't be better than England?
---
## MAUREEN:
No shite I'll be cleaning there, anyways, and no names called,

and Pato'II be there to have a say-so, any­ways,

if there was to be names called,

but I'm sure there won't be.

At the station I caught him, not five minutes to spare, thanks to you.
---
## MAUREEN:
Thanks to your ol' interfering.
---
## MAUREEN:
But too late to be inter­fering you are now.
---
## MAUREEN:
Oh aye, be far too late…
---
## MAUREEN:
although you did give it a good go, I'll say that for you.
---
## MAUREEN:
Another five minutes and you'd have had it.
---
## MAUREEN:
Poor you, poor selfish ol' bitch, ol' you.
---
## MAUREEN:
Kissed the face off me, he did, when he saw me there.
---
## MAUREEN:
Them blue eyes of his.
---
## MAUREEN:
Them muscles, them arms wrapping me.
---
## MAUREEN:
"Why did you not answer me letter?"
---
## MAUREEN:
And all for coming over and giving you a good kick he was when I told him,
---
## MAUREEN:
but "Ah no,"" I said, "isn't she just a feeble-minded ol' feck,"
---
## MAUREEN:
"not worth dirtying your boots on?"
---
## MAUREEN:
I was defending you there.
---
## MAUREEN:
"You will come to Boston with me so, me love , when you get up the money."
---
## MAUREEN:
I will, Pato.
---
## MAUREEN:
Be it married or be it living in sin, what do I care?
---
## MAUREEN:
What do I care if tongues'd be wagging?
---
## MAUREEN:
Tongues have wagged about me before, let them wag again.
---
## MAUREEN:
Let them never stop wagging.
---
## MAUREEN:
So long as I'm with you, Pato, what do I care about tongues?
---
## MAUREEN:
So long as it's you and me,
---
## MAUREEN:
and the warmth of us cud­dled up, and the skins of us asleep,
---
## MAUREEN:
is all I ever really wanted anyway.
---
## MAUREEN:
"Except we do still have a problem, what to do with your ol' mum, there," he said.
---
## MAUREEN:
"Would an ol' folks home be too harsh?"
---
## MAUREEN:
It wouldn't be too harsh, but it would be too expen­sive.
---
## MAUREEN:
"What about your sisters, so?"
---
## MAUREEN:
Me sisters wouldn't have the bitch.
---
## MAUREEN:
Not even a half-day at Christmas to be with her can them two stand.
---
## MAUREEN:
They clear forgot her birthday this year as well as that.
---
## MAUREEN:
"How do you stick her without going off your rocker?"
---
## MAUREEN:
they do say to me—behind her back, like.
---
## MAUREEN:
"I'll leave it up to your­self so," Pato says.
---
## MAUREEN:
He was on the train be this time, we was kissing out the window, like they do in films.
---
## MAUREEN:
"I'll leave it up to yourself so, whatever you decide."
---
## MAUREEN:
"If it takes a month, let it take a month."
---
## MAUREEN:
"And if it's finally you decide you can't bear to be parted from her"
---
## MAUREEN:
"and have to stay behind…"
---
## MAUREEN:
"Well, I can't say I would like it, but I'd understand."
---
## MAUREEN:
"But if even a year it has to take for you to decide,"
---
## MAUREEN:
"it is a year I will be waiting, and won't be minding the wait."
---
## MAUREEN:
*It won't be a year it is you'll be waiting, Pato,*
---
## MAUREEN:
I called out then, the train was pulling away.
---
## MAUREEN:
*It won't be a year nor yet nearly a year!*
---
## MAUREEN:
*It won't be a week!*
---
---
## MAUREEN:
'Twas over the stile she did trip.
---
## MAUREEN:
Aye.

## MAUREEN:
And down the hill she did fall.

Aye…Aye.

I did see you coming ahead up the road.

I didn't think so early you would be back.

Did you not want to go on to the reception or the what-you-call they're having at Rory's, so?

No.

Of course.

Going straight home, I think they said they'd be.

Oh aye.

Or fairly long.

It was.

and she could've got the last of the sun,

You'll be glad that's all over and done with now, anyways.
---
## MAUREEN:
Very glad.
---
## RAY:
I suppose they do only have their jobs to do.
---
## RAY:
Although no fan am I of the bastarding police.
---
## RAY:
Me too wee toes they went and broke on me for no reason,
---
## RAY:
me arsehole drunk and disorderly.
---
## MAUREEN:
The police broke your toes, did they?
---
## RAY:
They did.
---
## MAUREEN:
Oh.
---
## MAUREEN:
Tom Hanlon said what it was you kicked a door in just your socks.
---
## RAY:
Did he now?
---
## RAY:
And I suppose you believe a policeman's word over mine.
---
## RAY:
Oh aye.
---
## RAY:
Isn't that how the Birmingham Six went down?
---
## MAUREEN:
Sure, you can't equate your toes with the Birm­ingham Six, now, Ray.
---
## RAY:
It's the selfsame differ.
---
## RAY:
What was I saying, now?
---
## MAUREEN:
Some bull.
---
## RAY:
Some bull, is it?
---
## RAY:
No…asking about your mum's funeral, I was.
---
## MAUREEN:
That's what I'm saying.
---
## RAY:
Was there a big turnout at it?
---
## MAUREEN:
Me sisters and one of their husbands and nobody else but Maryjohnny Rafferty
---
## MAUREEN:
and ol' Father Walsh—
--
Welsh—
--
saying the thing.
---
## RAY:
Father Welsh punched Mairtin Hanlon in the head once,
---
## RAY:
and for no reason.
---
## RAY:
Are you not watching telly for yourself, no?
---
## MAUREEN:
I'm not.
---
## MAUREEN:
It's only Australian ol' shite they do ever show on that thing.
---
## RAY:
Sure, that's why I do like it.
---
## RAY:
Who wants to see Ireland on telly?
---
## MAUREEN:
I do.
---
## RAY:
All you have to do is look out your window to see Ireland.
---
## RAY:
And it's soon bored you'd be.
---
## RAY:
"There goes a calf."
---
## RAY:
l be bored anyway.
---
## RAY:
I be continually bored.
---
## RAY:
London I'm thinking of going to.
---
## RAY:
Aye. Thinking of it, anyways.
---
## RAY:
To work, y'know.
---
## RAY:
One of these days.
---
## RAY:
Or else Manchester.
---
## RAY:
They have a lot more drugs in Manchester.
---
## RAY:
Supposedly, anyways.
---
## MAUREEN:
Don't be getting messed up in drugs, now, Ray, for yourself.
---
## MAUREEN:
Drugs are terrible dangerous.
---
## RAY:
Terrible dangerous, are they?
---
## RAY:
Drugs, now?
---
## MAUREEN:
You know full well they are.
---
## RAY:
Maybe they are, maybe they are.
---
## RAY:
But there are plenty of other things just as dangerous,
---
## RAY:
would kill you just as easy.
---
## RAY:
Maybe even easter.
---
## MAUREEN:
Things like what, now?
---
## RAY:
This bastarding town for one.
---
## MAUREEN: (sadly)
Is true enough.
---
## RAY:
Just that it takes seventy years.
---
## RAY:
Well, it won't take me sev­enty years.
---
## RAY:
I'll tell you that.
---
## RAY:
No way, boy.
---
## RAY:
How old was your mother, now, when she passed?
---
## MAUREEN:
Seventy, aye.
---
## MAUREEN:
Bang on.
---
## RAY:
She had a good innings, anyway.
---
## RAY:
Or an innings, anyway.
---
## RAY:
What's this you've been burning?
---
## MAUREEN:
Porridge and Complan I've been burning.
---
## RAY:
For why?
---
## MAUREEN:
Because I don't eat porridge or Complan.
---
## MAUREEN:
The remainders of me mother's, they were.
---
## MAUREEN:
I was having a good clear­ out.
---
## RAY:
Only a waste that was.
---
## MAUREEN:
Do I need your say-so, so?
---
## RAY:
l'd've been glad to take them off your hands, I'm saying.
---
## MAUREEN: (quietly)
I don't need your say-so.
---
## RAY:
The porridge, anyway.
---
## RAY:
I do like a bit of porridge.
---
## RAY:
I'd've left the Complan.
---
## RAY:
I don't drink Complan.
---
## RAY:
Never had no call to.
---
## MAUREEN:
There's some Kimberleys left in the packet I was about to burn too,
---
## MAUREEN:
you can have, if it's such a big thing.
---
## RAY:
I will have them Kimberleys.
---
## RAY:
I do love Kimberleys.
---
## MAUREEN:
I bet you do.
---
## RAY:
Are they a bit stale, now?
---
## RAY:
It does be hard to tell with Kimberleys.
---
## RAY:
l think Kimberleys are me favorite bis­cuits out of any biscuits.
---
## RAY:
Them or Jaffa Cakes.
---
## RAY:
Or Wagon Wheels.
---
## RAY:
Or would you classify Wagon Wheels as biscuits at all now.
---
## RAY:
Aren't they more of a kind of a bar…?
---
## MAUREEN: (interrupting)
I've things to do now, Ray.
---
## MAUREEN:
Was it some reason you had to come over or was it just to discuss Wagon Wheels?
---
## RAY:
Oh aye, now.
---
## RAY:
No, I did have a letter from Pato the other day and he did ask me to come up.
---
## MAUREEN:
He did?
---
## MAUREEN:
What did he have to say?
---
## RAY:
He said sorry to hear about your mother and all, and his condolences he sent.
---
## MAUREEN:
Aye, aye, aye, and anything else, now?
---
## RAY:
That was the main gist of it, the message he said to pass onto you.
---
## MAUREEN:
It had no times or details, now?
---
## RAY:
Times or details?
---
## RAY:
No…
---
## MAUREEN:
I suppose…
---
## RAY:
Eh?
---
## MAUREEN:
Eh?
---
## RAY:
Eh?
---
## RAY:
Oh, also he said he was sorry he didn't get to see you the night he left, there,
---
## RAY:
he would've liked to've said goodbye.
---
## RAY:
But if that was the way you wanted it, so be it.
---
## RAY:
Although rude, too, I thought that was.
---
## MAUREEN:
I did see him the night he left.
---
## MAUREEN:
At the station there.
---
## RAY:
What station?
---
## RAY:
Be taxicab Pato left.
---
## RAY:
What are you thinking of?
---
## MAUREEN:
I don't know now.
---
## RAY:
Be taxicab Pato left,
---
## RAY:
and sad that he never got your good­bye,
---
## RAY:
although why he wanted your goodbye I don't know.
---
## RAY:
I'll tell you this, Maureen, not being harsh…
---
## RAY:
but your house does smell an awful lot nicer now that your mother's dead.
---
## RAY:
I'll say it does, now.
---
## MAUREEN:
Well, isn't that the best?
---
## MAUREEN:
With me thinking I did see him the night he left, there.
---
## MAUREEN:
The train that pulled away.
---
## RAY:
Aye, aye.
---
## RAY:
Have a rest for yourself.
---
## RAY:
Oh, do you know a lass called, um…
---
## RAY:
Dolores Hooley, or Healey, now?
---
## RAY:
She was over with the Yanks when they was over.
---
## MAUREEN:
I know the name, aye.
---
## RAY:
She was at me uncle's do they had there, dancing with me brother early on.
---
## RAY:
You remember?
---
## MAUREEN:
Dancing with him, was it?
---
## MAUREEN:
Throwing herself at him would be nearer the mark.
---
## MAUREEN:
Like a cheap ol' whore.
---
## RAY:
I don't know about that, now.
---
## MAUREEN:
Like a cheap ol' whore.
---
## MAUREEN:
And where did it get her?
---
## RAY:
She did seem nice enough to me, there, now.
---
## RAY:
Big brown eyes she had.
---
## RAY:
And I do like brown eyes, me, I do.
---
## RAY:
Oh aye.
---
## RAY:
Like the lass used to be on Bosco.
---
## RAY:
Or I think the lass used to be on Bosco had brown eyes.
---
## RAY:
We had a black and white telly at that time.
---
## RAY:
What was I talking about, now?
---
## MAUREEN:
Something about this Dolores Hooley or whoever she fecking is.
---
## RAY:
Oh aye.
---
## RAY:
Herself and Pato did get engaged a week ago, now, he wrote and told me.
---
## MAUREEN:
Engaged to do what?
---
## RAY:
Engaged to get married.
---
## RAY:
What do you usually get engaged for?
---
## RAY:
"Engaged to do what?"
---
## RAY:
Engaged to eat a bun!
---
## RAY:
A bit young for him, I think, but good luck to him.
---
## RAY:
A whirlwind ol' what-you-call.
---
## RAY:
July next year, they're thinking of having it,
---
## RAY:
but I'll have to write and tell him to move it either forward or back,
---
## RAY:
else it'll coincide with the European Championships.
---
## RAY:
I wonder if they'll have the European Champi­onships on telly over there at all?
---
## RAY:
Probably not, now, the Yankee bastards.
---
## RAY:
They don't care about football at all.
---
## RAY:
Ah well.
---
## RAY:
It won't be much of a change for her anyways,
---
## RAY:
from Hooley to Dooley.
---
## RAY:
Only one letter.
---
## RAY:
The "H".
---
## RAY:
That'll be a good thing.
---
## RAY:
Unless it's Healey that she is.
---
## RAY:
I can't remember.
---
## RAY:
If it's Healey, it'll be three letters.
---
## RAY:
The "H", the "E" and the "A".
---
## RAY:
Would you want me to be passing any message on, now, when I'm writing, Missus?
---
## RAY:
I'm writing tomorrow.
---
## MAUREEN:
I get…
--
I do get confused.
---
## MAUREEN:
Dolores Hooley…?
---
## RAY: (irritated)
Would you want me to be passing on any message, now, I'm saying?
---
## MAUREEN:
Dolores Hooley…?
---
## RAY: (sighing)
Fecking…
---
## RAY:
The loons you do get in this house!
---
## RAY:
Only repeating!
---
## MAUREEN:
Who's a loon?
---
## RAY:
Who's a loon, she says!
---
## MAUREEN: (angrily)
Who's a loon?!
---
## RAY: (angrily)
Well, isn't that fecking just the fecking best yet…!
---
## RAY:
Sit­ting on that fecking shelf all these fecking years you've had it,
---
## RAY:
and what good did it do ya?!
---
## RAY:
A tenner that swingball set did cost me poor ma and da,
---
## RAY:
and in 1979 that was, when a tenner was a lot of money.
---
## RAY:
The best fecking present I did ever get
---
## RAY:
and only two ol' months' play out of it I got
---
## RAY:
before you went and confis­cated it on me.
---
## RAY:
What right did you have?
---
## RAY:
What right at all?
---
## RAY:
No right.
---
## RAY:
And just left it sitting there then to fade to fecking skitter.
---
## RAY:
I wouldn't've minded if you'd got some use out of it,
---
## RAY:
if you'd taken the string out and played pat-ball or something against a wall, but no.
---
## RAY:
Just out of pure spite is the only reason you kept it,
---
## RAY:
and right under me fecking nose.
---
## RAY:
And then you go wondering who's a fecking loon?
---
## RAY:
Who's a fecking loon, she says.
---
## RAY:
I’ll tell you who's a fecking loon, lady.
---
## RAY:
You're a fecking loon!
---
## MAUREEN:
I don't know why I did keep your swingball on you, Raymond.
---
## MAUREEN:
I can't remember at all, now.
---
## MAUREEN:
I think me head was in a funny ol' way in them days.
---
## RAY:
"In them days,"" she says,
---
## RAY:
as she pegs a good poker on the floor and talks about trains.
---
## RAY:
That's a good poker, that is.
---
## RAY:
Don't be banging it against anything hard like that, now.
---
## MAUREEN:
I won't.
---
## RAY:
That's an awful good poker.
---
## RAY:
To show there's no hard feelings over me swingball,
---
## RAY:
will you sell me that poker, Missus?
---
## RAY:
A fiver I'll give you.
---
## MAUREEN:
Ah, I don't want to be selling me poker now, Ray.
---
## RAY:
G'wan.
---
## RAY:
Six!
---
## MAUREEN:
No.
---
## MAUREEN:
It does have sentimental value to me.
---
## RAY:
I don't forgive you, so!
---
## MAUREEN:
Ah, don't be like that, now, Ray…
---
## RAY:
No, I don't forgive you at all…
---
## MAUREEN:
Ray!
---
## MAUREEN:
Are you writing to your brother, so?
---
## RAY: (sighing)
I am…
--
Why?
---
## MAUREEN:
Will you be passing a message on from me?
---
## RAY: (sighing)
Messages, messages, messages, messages!
---
## RAY:
What's the message, so?
---
## RAY:
And make it a short one.
---
## MAUREEN:
Just say…
---
## RAY:
This week, if you can!
---
## MAUREEN:
Just say…
---
## MAUREEN:
Just say, "The beauty queen of Leenane says hello."
---
## MAUREEN:
That's all.
---
## RAY:
"The beauty queen of Leenane says hello."
---
## MAUREEN:
Aye. No!
---

---
## MAUREEN:
*Goodbye*. 
--
Goodbye.
---
## MAUREEN:
"The beauty queen of Leenane says goodbye."
---
## RAY:
"The beauty queen of Leenane says goodbye."
---
## RAY:
Whatever the feck that means, I'll pass it on.
---
## RAY:
"The beauty queen of Leenane says goodbye,"
---
## RAY:
although after this fecking swingball business,
---
## RAY:
I don't see why the feck I should.
---
## RAY:
Goodbye to you so, Missus…
---
## MAUREEN:
Will you turn the radio up a biteen, too,
---
## MAUREEN:
before you go, there, Pato, now?
---
## MAUREEN:
*Ray*, I mean…
---
## RAY: (exasperated)
Feck…

[music by The Chieftains plays as the radio turns on]

## RAY:
The exact fecking image of your mother you are, sitting there pegging orders and forgetting me name!
Goodbye!

And pull the door after you…

l was going to pull the fecking door after me!
