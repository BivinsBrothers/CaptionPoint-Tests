[the unusual bird squawks again]
---
## BABUR: (imitating bird)
*Caw caw! Caw!*

--
## HUMAYUN:
*Shhhh!*
---
## BABUR:
Which one is that?

--
## HUMAYUN:
*Shhhh!*
---
template: noise
[the unusual bird squawks again]
---
## BABUR:
I don’t know them like you know them…the birds.
---
## BABUR:
Which bird is that one?
---
## BABUR:
Chickadee? 
Sandgrouse? 
Thick-knee?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Shut up!
---
## BABUR:
You always know the birds, I don’t know any birds or—
---
## HUMAYUN:
Would you be quiet!?
---
## BABUR:
I’m just saying…
---
## HUMAYUN:
“Imperial guards of the great walled city of Agra,”
---
## HUMAYUN:
“sworn to the eternal dominion of his most supreme benevolence,”
---
## HUMAYUN:
“Emperor Shah Jahan,”
---
## HUMAYUN:
“do not speak.”

--
## BABUR:
You just spoke.
---
## HUMAYUN:
“Among the sacred oaths of the Mughal Imperial Guard is to…”
---
## HUMAYUN:
“*never speak*.”
---
## BABUR:
You keep talking about not talking.

--
## HUMAYUN:
“In silence, we are vigilant.”
---
## BABUR:
Swearing an oath to not speak: 
--
*Contradiction*!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Babur! Stop!
---
## HUMAYUN:
You have to be careful!

--
## BABUR:
Okay!
---
## HUMAYUN:
I’m serious!

--
## BABUR:
Okay.
---
## HUMAYUN:
They’ll release us from this honored fleet without a second thought!
---
## HUMAYUN:
The tiniest of infractions will see us both gone.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Quick-stuffed to the lowliest gullies of Agra.
---
## BABUR:
You won’t tell on me.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Well...
--
I won’t lie.
---
## BABUR:
Come on!
---
## BABUR:
We’re brothers, you and me.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We’re not brothers, we’re just friends.
---
---
## BABUR:
That’s insensitive.
---
## BABUR:
That makes me sad.
---
## BABUR:
I think of you as a brother.
---
## BABUR:
As a bhai.
---
## BABUR:
You call me bhai. I call you bhai.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Don’t make me lose my job.
---
## BABUR:
Hah!
---
## BABUR:
You?!
---
## BABUR:
And who is your father?
---
## BABUR:
Only simply the highest of high command in the all-on-high Imperial Guard.
---
## HUMAYUN:
My father yearns for my defeat.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Always has.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You know him.
---
## BABUR:
Sons are sons.
---
## BABUR:
Fathers are fathers.
---
## BABUR:
And one day you’ll be chief top boss man of the Imperial Guard just like him.
---
## HUMAYUN:
That will never happen.
---
## HUMAYUN:
He thinks I’m soft.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Stop talking.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Stand guard.

[insects]
---
---
## BABUR:
You know what I wonder about?

--
## HUMAYUN:
No. Shut up.
---
## BABUR:
I was wondering…
---
## BABUR:
When will we get to guard the Imperial Harem?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Ha.
---
## BABUR:
I’m serious, when?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Guards of the Imperial Harem are tip-top guards.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Seniority. Best position in the fleet.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We are not “tip-top”.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We get the dawn watch.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We’ll both be grey and toothless before they let *us* guard the Harem.
---
## BABUR:
But your father…
---
## BABUR:
Maybe he could—
--

## HUMAYUN:
That will never happen.
---
## BABUR:
Never?

--
## HUMAYUN:
Absolutely never.
---
## BABUR:
Man, I want to see the Harem.
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s supposed to be pretty boring.
---
## BABUR: (skeptical)
*Really*.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s not so salacious a venue as the gossip would have you think.
---
## BABUR:
It’s a *harem*.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s a government department, like any other office.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s where the Emperor does his most confidential work.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Thus, only the Mahaldar, the concubines and eunuchs are allowed within the walls…
---
## HUMAYUN:
and the two most trusted Imperial Guards who are, decidedly, *not us*.
---
## BABUR: (marveling)
But I mean…
---
## BABUR: (marveling)
Surrounded by naked women!
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s not like that!

--
## BABUR:
Okay.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s not some depraved house of sluts!

--
## BABUR:
Okay.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s not some hotbed of wanton lust!

--
## BABUR: (totally unconvinced)
*Okay*.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s just…you know…
---
## HUMAYUN:
A place the Emperor goes…
---
## HUMAYUN:
…to work.
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
Let’s stand guard.
---
## BABUR:
Okay.
---
---
## BABUR: (in gruff voice)
Harem duty…
---
## BABUR: (in gruff voice)
Harem duty!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Stop.

## BABUR: (in high voice)
Harem duty…
---
## HUMAYUN:
STOP!

## BABUR: (in high voice)
Harem duty!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Babur, that’s messed up, man, stop it!
---
## BABUR:
I want to see that harem before I die.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Well, you can improve your chances by showing up on time
---
## HUMAYUN:
and shutting your seditious mouth.
---
## BABUR:
“Seditious?”

--
## HUMAYUN:
You heard me.
---
## BABUR:
How is that *seditious*?

--
## HUMAYUN:
It just is.
---
## BABUR:
I was making a joke.

--
## HUMAYUN:
Mild sedition.
---
## BABUR:
*Mild*?
---
## BABUR:
According to who?
---
## HUMAYUN:
According to the King!
---
## HUMAYUN:
If you had paid attention in training,
---
## HUMAYUN:
you would know that sedition is recognized at three levels
---
## HUMAYUN:
in accordance with his most supreme and benevolent monarch.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You just made a humorous commentary at the expense
---
## HUMAYUN:
of the King’s most beloved bureaucratic office.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Punishment for mild sedition:

--
40 lashes with a whip and a shaved head.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yes. And medium sedition carries a sentence of blinding.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Extreme sedition: 
--
being sown into the hide of a water buffalo
---
## HUMAYUN:
and left in the sun for seven days.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And in the case of treason: 
--
death by elephant.
---
## HUMAYUN:
All of which is to say, Babur…
--
*shut up*.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Imperial Guards are not to speak!
---
## BABUR:
Okay!

[the unusual bird squawks]

## HUMAYUN:
Red-breasted jibjab.

## HUMAYUN:
That’s what it is.
---
## HUMAYUN:
The bird.
---
## BABUR:
You’re good, Huma.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Now please.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Quiet.

template: noise
[insects]
---
## BABUR:
Huma? Do you ever wonder…

--
## HUMAYUN:
No.
---
## BABUR:
All these celestial luminations that mark our sky…
---
## HUMAYUN:
What of them?
---
## BABUR:
The stars: what are they?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Determinations of our fates and futures.
---
## BABUR:
But what ARE they?
---
## BABUR:
Are they like fires in the distance?
---
## BABUR:
And if so, if you get closer to them, do they become, you know, brighter and hotter?
---
## BABUR:
And if so, how far away are they exactly?
---
## BABUR:
In the mountains, you can determine the closeness of a point,
---
## BABUR:
but in the sky, there are no such methods of orientation.
---
---
## BABUR:
Humayun. 
--
Humayun. 
--
Humayun. 
--
Humayun.

--
## HUMAYUN:
WHAT?
---
## BABUR:
One day?
---
## BABUR:
Thousands of years from now?
---
## BABUR:
I bet there will be a sort of palanquin that can soar into the stars like some giant bird.
---
## HUMAYUN:
A giant palanquin bird.
---
## BABUR:
Yeah.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Palanquins are for women.
---
## BABUR:
Not this one.
---
## BABUR:
This one will be for everyone.
---
## BABUR:
Except, rather than men, or elephants,
---
## BABUR:
this will be carried by some unfound-as-of-yet force—
---
## BABUR:
up to the stars!
---
## BABUR:
And in this palanquin, one might track those little fires in the sky.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You and your fantasies.
---
## BABUR:
Not fantasies…predictions.
---
## BABUR:
And you like them.
---
## BABUR:
You’ve always liked them.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Fairy tales for children.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Not Imperial Guards.
---
## BABUR:
And this flying palanquin will be fast.
---
## BABUR:
Faster than any horse, or any bird.
---
## BABUR: (mimicking speeding bird)
*Whshoo!* 
--
*Whshoo!* 
--
*Whshoo!* 
--
*Fast!*
---
## BABUR:
You understand, Huma?
---
## BABUR:
And, so, *whshoo!* you will be able to get closer to those fires in the sky.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And then?
---
## BABUR:
They must be leading us somewhere.
---
## BABUR:
If they are determinations of our fates,
---
## BABUR:
then they must be arranged by some grand conspirator.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Allah.
---
## BABUR:
Yeah. Allah.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Allahu Akbar.
---
## BABUR: (unconvinced)
...Yeah. 
--
Sure.
---
## BABUR:
But something else, too, right?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Blasphemy.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Come on, don’t say that.
---
## BABUR:
It’s only something I wonder about.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s not meant for us to know.
---
## BABUR:
But maybe it is!
---
## BABUR:
If there is something to see, and therefore, something to think about,
---
## BABUR:
and therefore something to wonder about…
---
## BABUR:
then there’s something to go towards.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Like a moth to a candle or a tiger to a trap.
---
## BABUR:
No.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Then what?
---
## BABUR:
I think God wants us to learn more and more things.
---
## BABUR:
I mean…
---
## BABUR:
Look what is about to be revealed behind us!
---
## HUMAYUN:
No. Don’t. 
--
Don’t look.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Imperial Guards are not to move.
---
## BABUR:
They say it will be the most beautiful thing in the world.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yes, well, His Supreme Highness has specified that it *should* be, and so it *will* be.
---
## BABUR:
What do you think it will look like?
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
They say it’s white.
---
## BABUR:
Yeah, but just white?
---
## BABUR:
Is it skinny?
---
## BABUR:
Is it fat?
---
## BABUR:
I mean, what shape will it be?
---
## BABUR:
All we know are those protective walls that have hidden it these past 16 years.
---
## HUMAYUN:
The city within the city.
---
## BABUR:
It’s crazy!
---
## BABUR:
Sixteen years in the making!
---
## BABUR:
Since we were kids, they’ve been building this!
---
## BABUR:
And yet we have no idea what it will look like!
---
## BABUR:
Because within the walls, where Taj Mahal is built,
---
## BABUR:
another city, a secret one, with strange men who have lived a different life than anyone else!
---
## HUMAYUN:
His most supreme Emperor Shah Jahan decreed
---
## HUMAYUN:
that no one shall see it until it is fully completed.
---
## BABUR:
But why?
---
## HUMAYUN:
There need not be a reason, it is a royal decree!
---
## HUMAYUN:
*The construction of Taj Mahal is not to be seen by anyone*
---
## HUMAYUN:
*except the masons, laborers and slaves who exist within those walls*.
---
## BABUR:
And the architect.
---
## BABUR: (with great reverence)
*Ustad Isa*.
---
## HUMAYUN: (with less reverence)
…Ustad Isa.
---
## BABUR: (dramatically)
*Ustad Isa*.
---
## BABUR:
They say he is the smartest man in the kingdom.
---
## BABUR:
In any kingdom.
---
## BABUR:
The smartest man on earth.
---
## HUMAYUN: (with disdain)
Doubtful.
---
## BABUR:
He speaks to the King.
---
## BABUR:
He looks the King in the eye.
---
## BABUR:
He is equal to the King.
---
## HUMAYUN:
That is mild-to-medium sedition.
---
## BABUR:
But then he drinks with the masons.
---
## BABUR:
And he frequents the whores.
---
## BABUR:
He built a school for the peasant children on his day off.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I saw it, it was too big.
---
## BABUR:
He smiles at everyone!
---
## BABUR:
Can you imagine such a thing?
---
## BABUR:
Smiling at *every person*.
---
## BABUR:
The happiest man in the world.
---
## HUMAYUN:
The happiest man in the world is also the craziest.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Behead that man.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Kick his skull to the dogs.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Let them play with it, as dogs do.
---
## BABUR:
Do you know why he’s the happiest?
---
## HUMAYUN:
I just said.
---
## BABUR:
Do you remember that thing we made in the trees?
---
## BABUR:
First year in the army.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Our platform.
---
## BABUR:
We were three nights in the woods, afraid of tigers.
---
## BABUR:
It was like floating in the branches, high above the jungle!
---
## BABUR:
We used our swords to smoothen the wood.
---
## BABUR:
Cut it so it fit together.
---
## BABUR:
Smooth, clean ledge!
---
## BABUR:
Some of the wood was sandalwood.
---
## BABUR:
The scent of it cloaked us through the night, protecting us from mosquitoes.
---
## BABUR:
Ahhh!
---
## BABUR:
The rough perfume of sandalwood!
---
## HUMAYUN:
I have never slept as soundly as I slept on that raft we made in the trees.
---
## BABUR:
Do you remember how good it felt when we had completed it?
---
## BABUR:
Sitting, admiring it, bathed in sweat, drinking cold river water.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yes.
---
## BABUR:
Now: think how Ustad Isa must feel.
---
## BABUR:
Sixteen years in the making, surrounded by those walls,
---
## BABUR:
so that no one may see it until it is complete…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Which is today’s first light.
---
## BABUR:
Which is today’s first light.
---
## BABUR:
And for sixteen years, he built this thing.
---
## BABUR:
He smiles at everyone, because he is happy.
---
## BABUR:
Because he made Taj Mahal.
---
## BABUR:
Ustad Isa is amazing!
---
## BABUR:
Even God couldn’t make Taj Mahal!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Blasphemy!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Would you stop?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Don’t forget the punishment for blasphemy is three days in prison.
---
## BABUR:
That is weird, though, isn’t it?
---
## HUMAYUN:
What?
---
## BABUR:
Mild sedition—for example, making a joke!— is…
---
## BABUR:
whipping, shaved head, *torture*…
---
## BABUR:
but *blasphemy*…
---
## BABUR:
just three days in jail!
---
## BABUR:
As if the Emperor doesn’t *really* care about speaking ill of Allah.
---
## BABUR:
He’s way more concerned about himself.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Don’t test him!
---
## HUMAYUN:
And stop with this Ustad Isa talk.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Taj Mahal was made by His Sovereign Ruler of Hindustan, Shah Jahan,
---
## HUMAYUN:
who built this for his tragic queen, Her Excellent Empress Mumtaz Mahal.
---
## HUMAYUN:
This is her tomb, a mausoleum to honor her for all time.
---
## BABUR:
Nah.

--
## HUMAYUN:
Nah what?!
---
## BABUR:
Ustad Isa.
---
## BABUR:
He made Taj Mahal.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Oh yeah?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Did Ustad Isa import the pietra dura from Greece?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Or the herringbone from Iraq?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Or the marble from China?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Or 700 tons of jasper from some damn fool slum in Uzbekistan!?
---
## HUMAYUN:
No: he didn’t.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Shah Jahan did.
---
## BABUR:
Ustad Isa says that today’s first light is important for Taj Mahal because *after* today,
---
## BABUR:
the air and the rain and the sand and heat of sun will start to age her perfect face.
---
## BABUR:
But that today, at first light,
---
## BABUR:
Taj Mahal will be the most beautiful thing in the history of everything that has *ever existed*.
---
## BABUR:
Think about it!
---
## BABUR:
The most beautiful thing ever made…
---
## BABUR:
Taj Mahal is sitting there, waiting to be lit by the day’s first light…
---
## BABUR:
waiting to be seen.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We are not turning around.
---
## BABUR:
AW, COME ON MAN!
---
## HUMAYUN:
No.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We are guarding.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We are facing South.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Not North. 
--
South.
---
## BABUR:
Just for a quick moment!
---
## BABUR:
We turn around, we turn back around…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Absolutely not.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Imperial Guards do not move from their post.
---
## BABUR:
They don’t speak either, but here we are speaking for…

--
## HUMAYUN:
We’re not turning around!
---
## HUMAYUN:
We are Imperial Guards!
---
## HUMAYUN:
This is very important to me!
---
## BABUR:
To me as well.
---
## HUMAYUN:
People are watching us.
---
## BABUR:
Who?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Elders.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Waiting for us to deviate from the sacred oaths.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You and me, Babur, there is no one below us.
---
## HUMAYUN:
If there is a post that nobody wants?
---
## HUMAYUN:
For example, the one single guard post that faces AWAY from Taj Mahal at dawn?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Then we are assigned that post.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We are grunts of the Imperial Force until that day new appointments are made.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And until that day: *we get the jobs nobody else wants*.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Unless, of course, we are sacked for being stupid…
---
## HUMAYUN:
because we turned around at first light to see a white building.
---
## HUMAYUN:
They’d send us to the brink.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We’d end up patrolling Kashmir…
---
## HUMAYUN:
a place to which, if some bastard is assigned, some bastard ends up dead.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Do you want to go patrol Kashmir?

--
## BABUR:
No.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Do you want 40 lashes and a shaved head?

--
## BABUR:
No.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Do you want to be blinded by a dull blade?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Or sewn into the hide of a water buffalo?
---
## BABUR:
No.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Or maybe you want to end up like poor Ustad Isa and…
---
## BABUR:
Wait, what?

--
## HUMAYUN:
Nothing.
---
## BABUR:
No, what were you just saying?

--
## HUMAYUN:
Nothing. Forget it.
---
## BABUR:
What about Ustad Isa?

--
## HUMAYUN:
Nothing.
---
## BABUR:
Come on, what?

--
## HUMAYUN:
Nothing.
---
## BABUR:
Humayun.

--
## HUMAYUN:
No.
---
## BABUR:
Huma…

--
## HUMAYUN:
No.
---
## BABUR:
Tell me.

--
## HUMAYUN:
No.
---
## BABUR:
What have you heard?
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s simple: don’t be careless.
---
## BABUR:
Come on. Tell me.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Okay.
---
## HUMAYUN:
But you can’t tell anyone.
---
## BABUR:
I promise!
---
## BABUR:
Who keeps a promise better than me?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Okay.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It has been said—that after the last jewels were inlaid, and the last piece of marble polished—
---
## HUMAYUN:
It has been said—that this wastrel, this cur—
---
## HUMAYUN:
Ustad Isa—the proud architect who thinks himself equal to a King,
---
## HUMAYUN:
approached Shah Jahan himself and asked His Excellent Mughal Lineage…
---
## HUMAYUN:
for a *personal* favor.
---
---
## BABUR:
A *personal* favor?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yes.
---
## BABUR:
He asked the Emperor for a personal favor?
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t even know which level of sedition that is…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Because it’s never been classified!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Because nobody’s ever done it!
---
## HUMAYUN:
This is the kind of useless vagabond your brilliant artist is.
---
## HUMAYUN:
He asks Shah Jahan, great great grandson of Babur, First Mughal Emperor—
---
## BABUR:
—my namesake.
---
## HUMAYUN:
—your namesake—Ustad Isa asks Shah Jahan for things such as these, personal things.
---
## BABUR: (melodramatically)
My God.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yes.
---
## BABUR:
What was it?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Ustad Isa asked Shah Jahan…
---
## HUMAYUN:
if the 20,000 men who built it could wander the unsheathed Taj Mahal at first light,

## HUMAYUN:
so that they could see and admire their  handiwork,
---
## HUMAYUN:
this thing to which they owe the last 16 years of their lives.
---
## BABUR:
Oh. Huh.
---
## BABUR:
What did Shah Jahan reply?
---
## HUMAYUN:
His Supreme Excellent Imperious Royalty 
--
said “No.”
---
## BABUR:
Oh.
---
## HUMAYUN:
But there is a rumor.
---
## BABUR:
Of?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Having never in his life been asked a personal favor before—
---
## HUMAYUN:
His Most Sovereign Enlightened One
---
## HUMAYUN:
needed time to fully *absorb* the gross insult hurled upon him.
---
## BABUR:
The Emperor is angry.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah.
---
## HUMAYUN:
The Emperor is angry.
---
## HUMAYUN:
So now the Emperor has issued a decree:
---
## HUMAYUN:
Nothing so beautiful as Taj Mahal shall ever be built again.
---
## BABUR:
What kind of decree is *that*?
---
## HUMAYUN:
He has ordered that the hands of every mason, laborer and artisan who crafted Taj Mahal…
---
## HUMAYUN:
be chopped off.
---
## BABUR:
WHAT?
---
## BABUR:
Wait wait wait.
---
## BABUR:
He’s going to chop 20,000 hands off?
---
## HUMAYUN:
40,000.
---
## BABUR:
Because they wanted to look at Taj Mahal?
---
## HUMAYUN:
We need not ask why.
---
## HUMAYUN:
A royal decree is exactly that.
---
## BABUR:
Every worker?
---
## BABUR:
Every man who built this?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Every one.
---
## BABUR:
So someone is going to have to chop off 40,000 hands?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yep.
---
## BABUR:
That’s a terrible job.
---
## BABUR:
Who’s going to have to do that?
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
Shit.
---
## BABUR:
Oh no…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Shit.
---
## BABUR:
It’s us, right?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Shit.
---
## BABUR:
I don’t want to do that!
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t either.
---
## BABUR:
Shit.
---
---
## BABUR:
Well, I think the Emperor is overreacting.
---
## BABUR:
40,000 severed hands.
---
## BABUR:
What’s the purpose of such punishment?
---
## HUMAYUN:
*Nothing so beautiful as Taj Mahal shall ever be built again.*

## BABUR:
Huma…
---
## HUMAYUN:
What?
---
## BABUR:
If a flying palanquin did exist, like the one I said…
---
## BABUR:
and a person could fly to those little fires in the sky…
---
## BABUR:
would you go?
---
## HUMAYUN:
If it pleased His All-Powerful Reign.
---
## BABUR:
I would go, even if it didn’t please him.
---
## BABUR:
What an invention that would be!
---
## BABUR:
I would call it…
---
## BABUR:
an Allah-aero-platforma-al-Agra-Babura…
---
## BABUR:
Or for short…
---
## BABUR:
“Aeroplat”.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Aeroplat.
---
## BABUR:
Can you imagine?
---
## BABUR:
To be as far away as that?
---
## BABUR:
Agra would seem no bigger than the flickering up there.
---
## BABUR:
We are as small as that, Huma.
---
## BABUR:
And further away from that, we are smaller.
---
## BABUR:
And further away from that…
---
## BABUR:
we don’t exist.
---
## BABUR:
There is no proof of us, or this place, of Taj Mahal,
---
## BABUR:
or Shah Jahan or Hindustan, or the razai of candlelight above our heads.
---
## BABUR:
Far enough away…
---
## BABUR:
is another world, with different Kings, and different Imperial Guards.
---
## BABUR:
Different Gods, even.
---
---
## HUMAYUN: (panicking)
Babur, what are you doing?

## HUMAYUN:
Turn back around!

## HUMAYUN:
You…you can’t…

Babur!

## BABUR:
Humayun.

## HUMAYUN:
Turn around!

## BABUR:
Humayun.

## HUMAYUN:
Babur, if anyone sees you…

--
## BABUR:
Humayun!
---
## HUMAYUN:
*Why are you doing this, man!?*

--
## BABUR:
I think you should look.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We can look at any other time!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Any other time except now!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Why is it so important to risk everything to look at this now!?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Turn around!

## HUMAYUN:
Babur!

## HUMAYUN:
Raise your sword!

There’s no one watching.

Not us, Huma.

Trust me.

There are no eyes in this land that would waste themselves on us.

I’m blind!

I’m fucking blind!

You’re not blind.

You probably just got smoke in them.

I can’t let go…

They’re stuck.

I CAN’T LET GO OF MY SWORD!

You’re just cramped.

Relax.

I CAN’T LET GO OF MY HANDS!

JUST RELAX!

Don’t tell me to relax!

Your hands are just cramped!

From all the chopping!

Relax and you can—

Don’t tell me to relax!

I’m *blind* okay?

## BABUR:
You’re not blind.

Well un-cramp them!

Here.

No, turn around.

No, turn halfway around!

Relax them.

God.

## BABUR:
I know.

## HUMAYUN:
What just happened?
---
## BABUR:
I don’t know.
---
## BABUR:
Twenty thousand men.

## BABUR:
Forty thousand hands.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I can’t believe we chopped off forty thousand hands.
---
## BABUR:
NO.

--
## HUMAYUN:
No what?
---
## BABUR:
*I* cut off forty thousand.
---
## BABUR:
You cauterized.
---
## BABUR:
I chopped, you cauterized.
---
## HUMAYUN:
So?

--
## BABUR:
Different!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Both unsavory.

--
## BABUR:
Different!
---
## HUMAYUN:
How’s it different?
---
## BABUR:
I took apart, you put together.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We could have switched!
---
## HUMAYUN:
You think I was having a party over there, cauterizing stumps?
---
## HUMAYUN:
I went blind!
---
## BABUR:
You’re not blind!
---
## HUMAYUN:
You get cramps in your hands, I go blind, who had the worse job?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Answer me that, *fucko*.
---
## BABUR:
IT WAS DIFFERENT.
---
## BABUR:
I chopped off hands.
---
## BABUR:
And then, instead of bleeding to death, you stopped the bleeding.
---
## BABUR:
I caused damage that you then healed.
---
## BABUR:
How do you not see the difference in these things?!
---
## BABUR:
How do you not see that?
---
## HUMAYUN:
*Because I’m blind!*
---
## BABUR:
Just massage my hands so I can get you water,
---
## BABUR:
so I can stop hearing about how blind you are.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I’m trying.
---
## BABUR:
Try harder.
---
## BABUR:
Chopping was worse.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We could have switched.
---
## BABUR:
But we couldn’t!
---
## BABUR:
We fell into a rhythm!
---
## HUMAYUN:
We fell into a trance.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t even remember.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s like I don’t even remember doing it.
---
## BABUR:
I do.
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
You know that uh…
---
## HUMAYUN:
That invention you had?
---
## HUMAYUN:
The…uh…
---
## HUMAYUN:
“Allaporta-palanquin-pa”?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Or…was that it?
---
## BABUR:
Aeroplat.
---
## HUMAYUN:
The thing that could fly to the stars?
---
## HUMAYUN:
That was a good idea.
---
## HUMAYUN:
But I was wondering…
---
## HUMAYUN:
What if you fell off?
---
## HUMAYUN:
If this mechanism was soaring to the stars, like some giant bird with cushions,
---
## HUMAYUN:
wouldn’t one be in danger of being swept away by the wind,
---
## HUMAYUN:
or maybe in an effort to see the everything below,
---
## HUMAYUN:
the palaces and streets and jungles,
---
## HUMAYUN:
wouldn’t curiosity, couldn’t it, somehow…
---
## HUMAYUN:
make a curious person peer too far over the edge of his flying box…
---
## HUMAYUN:
and then plummet down and then, 
--
*splatooey*?
---
## BABUR:
There would be a strap.
---
## HUMAYUN:
A strap?
---
## BABUR:
Attached to the sitting cushion.
---
## BABUR:
Wrapping around the stomach like a belt.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Some kind of “seat” belt.
---
## BABUR:
Yes.
---
## HUMAYUN:
That’s a good idea.
---
## BABUR:
Yeah.
---
## BABUR: (laughing, in relief)
*Ahhhhhhh*…Yes!
---
## HUMAYUN:
There you go…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Now, please get me some water?

I don’t know why water’s going to make you see.

I just need something….

Yeah.

## HUMAYUN:
We have to clean this ourselves?

## BABUR:
Yeah.
---
## HUMAYUN:
This is woman’s work.

## BABUR:
I know.

## HUMAYUN:
There should literally be twenty women in here cleaning this right now.

## BABUR:
At least.

## HUMAYUN:
I mean, not that I’d want…

## HUMAYUN:
I wouldn’t want a woman to have to see this.

## BABUR: (somber)
What we just did was terrible.

I t was our job, okay?

So is cleaning.

Let’s clean.

Let’s clean.

What do we do with all of those baskets of hands?

Burn them.

Outside.

That’s going to smell terrible.

We’ll see them around.

Probably begging.

And they’ll see us.

## BABUR:
They’ll remember you and me, Huma.

## BABUR:
They hate us.

## BABUR:

## HUMAYUN:

## HUMAYUN:
Your flying invention with the “seat” belt was a good idea.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I, too, have an idea.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I have an invention, too.
---
## HUMAYUN:
*A transportable hole.*
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s literally a hole you could take anywhere with you.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And you could attach it to anything.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And anything you attached it to would suddenly have a hole in it.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Say you wanted to go through a wall?
---
## HUMAYUN:
You could.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Or say you are trapped in a dungeon.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Or you are in the desert and it is so hot!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Hole in the ground, now you can sleep in some shade.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Also there would be things to eat in the hole.
---
## BABUR:
What would there be to eat?
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t know.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Beef curry. Parathas.
---
## BABUR:
It wouldn’t fall out?
---
## HUMAYUN:
What?
---
## BABUR:
Food wouldn’t fall out? Of the hole?
---
## HUMAYUN:
No, it would be *in* the hole.
---
## BABUR:
But the hole’s a hole.
---
## HUMAYUN:
A *transportable* hole.
---
---
## BABUR:
How would you carry it?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Carry what?
---
## BABUR:
The transportable hole.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It would have a sack.
---
## BABUR:
A sack?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Inside the sack: 
--
transportable hole.
---
## BABUR:
What if I were in the sack?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Why would you be in the sack?
---
## BABUR:
For example if I was.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s not a very big sack.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You wouldn’t fit.
---
## BABUR:
It’s a small sack?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Big enough only for the transportable hole.
---
## BABUR:
It’s a small hole?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Small enough to fit in the sack.
---
## HUMAYUN:
But then…as holes are, it could grow and shrink in size.
---
## BABUR:
But what if I were in the sack?
---
## HUMAYUN:
You wouldn’t fit inside the sack, as I’ve said, it’s a small sack.
---
## BABUR:
But say I was very small.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Suddenly you are very small.

--
## BABUR:
Yes.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Small enough to fit inside the sack.

--
## BABUR:
Yes.
---
## BABUR:
I’m trapped, see, inside the sack.
---
## HUMAYUN:
How did you shrink?
---
## BABUR:
There was a potion, from some witch.
---
## HUMAYUN:
OK.
---
## BABUR:
And so now I’m very small, and someone has gone and put me in the sack.
---
## HUMAYUN:
With the transportable hole?
---
## BABUR:
No, the transportable hole isn’t there yet.
---
## BABUR:
It’s out of the sack.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You took it out of the sack?
---
## BABUR:
I didn’t take it…
---
## BABUR:
It was already out when I was captured and put in the sack.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Who took it out?
---
## BABUR:
The boss man who owns it.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Maybe the Emperor.
---
## BABUR:
You would think the Emperor.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Seeing as the transportable hole is probably a very rare, expensive thing.
---
## BABUR:
That’s what I was thinking.
---
## BABUR:
Not everyone gets a transportable hole.
---
## BABUR:
Too many transportable holes would be a bad idea,
---
## BABUR:
as they might take up everything, the whole world, and then what?
---
## BABUR:
What if everything was a hole?
---
---
## BABUR:
I have another invention, too, about something you could put inside clouds.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Wait, go back to when you are inside the sack.
---
## BABUR:
Oh yeah, because I’ve shrunken to a very small size.
---
## HUMAYUN:
How small, like a child?
---
## BABUR:
No, like a doll a child plays with.
---
## HUMAYUN:
That’s very small.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And you’re in the sack.
---
## BABUR:
Trapped inside, because the boss man, probably the Emperor,
---
## BABUR:
captured me and put me in there.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Punished for being too small.
---
## BABUR:
But because the sack I’m trapped in…
---
## BABUR:
is also the sack with which to transport the transportable hole,
---
## BABUR:
the transportable hole is now put into the sack.
---
## BABUR:
With me.
---
## BABUR:
Now: I’m in a sack that has a hole in it.
---
## BABUR:
So: Can I escape?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Well, you could just go right through the hole.
---
## BABUR:
Exactly!
---
## HUMAYUN:
That’s what the hole is for.
---
## BABUR:
But could the transportable hole…
---
## BABUR:
Wouldn’t it also fall through its own hole?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Could the hole fall through itself?
---
## BABUR:
It’s a good question.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Sure, it could.
---
## BABUR:
Well if it could, then the sack isn’t a very good sack with which to carry it.
---
## HUMAYUN:
That is true.
---
## BABUR:
Nothing could carry it.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Nothing could ever carry it.
---
## BABUR:
And then how do you take the hole places?
---
---
## HUMAYUN: (crestfallen)
You couldn’t.
---
## HUMAYUN: (crestfallen)
Nobody could.
---
## HUMAYUN: (crestfallen)
It’s a useless invention.
---
---
## BABUR:
Unless you had two sacks!
---
## BABUR:
And the hole simply led to the other sack,
---
## BABUR:
so even if the hole went through itself, it would end up in the other sack,
---
## BABUR:
and then back again in the corresponding sack.
---
## BABUR:
Like an hourglass.

I thought about things I would invent.

I thought there would be a thing, like tea maybe, that you could put in the clouds,
---
## BABUR:
and then, when it began to rain, the rain would be different colors, maybe,
---
## BABUR:
and also taste sweet,
---
## BABUR:
and imagine if we were out in the rain and there were colors over everything,
---
## BABUR:
bright blues and greens and pinks and it also tasted really good…

## BABUR:
Maybe it was also alcoholic, and so was like wine, and so you also got drunk.
---
## BABUR:
Cloud tea.
---
## HUMAYUN:
That’s a fantastic invention.
---
## BABUR:
I have another invention which is an invisible house for a garden,
---
## BABUR:
and you could plant things inside the house.
---
## BABUR:
I also thought, my aeroplat, that would fly to the stars?
---
## BABUR:
You could make a smaller one that would just take you to Turkey.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Why would it take you to Turkey?
---
## BABUR:
It would fly you there.
---
## HUMAYUN:
But why Turkey necessarily?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Why not somewhere else?
---
## BABUR:
This aeroplat would go to Turkey.
---
## BABUR:
Ustad Isa was in Turkey once.
---
## BABUR:
He said there were compassionate whores in Turkey,
---
## BABUR:
and the air was cool.
---
## BABUR:
So this particular aeroplat is going to Turkey.
---
## HUMAYUN:
*Compassionate* whores?

--
## BABUR:
Yeah.
---
## HUMAYUN:
How long does it take to get to Turkey?
---
## BABUR:
He was the only one who didn’t scream.
---
## BABUR:
Ustad Isa.
---
## BABUR:
He didn’t scream.
---
## BABUR:
He only looked at me and…
---
## BABUR:
He was the smartest man in the kingdom, Huma.
---
## BABUR:
The smartest man on Earth.
---
## BABUR:
He could do anything.
---
## BABUR:
And now…

--
no hands.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Everything is over now, okay?
---
## BABUR:
Everything is over?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah.
---
## BABUR:
Imagine if you didn’t have your hands.
---
## HUMAYUN:
No.
---
## BABUR:
No, what?
---
## HUMAYUN:
No, I’m not going to imagine that.
---
## BABUR:
You should.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Why?
---
## BABUR:
After what we just did.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We just did our job.
---
## BABUR:
But just imagine what that must be like…
---
## BABUR:
To have both your hands *chopped off* and then the stumps cauterized,
---
## BABUR:
and then sent back into the world to do…
---
## BABUR:
To do what?
---
## BABUR:
To do what with the rest of your life?
---
## BABUR:
How do you eat?
---
## BABUR:
How do you drink?
---
## BABUR:
How do you scratch an itch?
---
## BABUR:
How do you wipe your ass, Huma?
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t care, just shut up, okay?
---
## BABUR:
A man with no hands is a man who cannot be useful.
---
## BABUR:
An unuseful man is a devil.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Tell me some other inventions.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Do you have other inventions?
---
---
## BABUR:
What if the transportable hole had no bottom?
---
## BABUR:
Like I put it on the ground and I fall through it,
---
## BABUR:
and so I fall through the world, and I pop out on the other side,
---
## BABUR:
in some strange, far off land, as far away as you could possibly get from where we are…
---
## BABUR:
Could the transportable hole do that?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Maybe.
---
## BABUR:
I want the hole more than the aeroplat.
---
## HUMAYUN:
More than Turkey?
---
## BABUR:
More than Turkey.
---
## HUMAYUN:
More than compassionate whores?
---
## BABUR:
More than anything.
---
## HUMAYUN:
That they are *compassionate*…
---
## HUMAYUN:
This is what sets them apart?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Why did Ustad Isa use this particular word?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Did he fall ill?
---
## HUMAYUN:
They tended to him?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Were they very good listeners?
---
## HUMAYUN:
*Compassionate!*

[Humayun groans]
---
## HUMAYUN:
What?
---
## BABUR:
Nothing.
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
It is true, though, what you say…
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s got to be a terrible thing.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Spend 16 years building Taj Mahal…
---
## HUMAYUN:
and then to not be able to build anything again.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Chop off these hands…
---
## HUMAYUN:
*…so that nothing so beautiful as Taj Mahal shall ever be built again*.
---
## HUMAYUN:
The Emperor is a serious man, bhai.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Nothing so beautiful ever built again.
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
You know when you think about it…
---
## HUMAYUN:
I guess that means that the most beautiful thing ever made…
---
## HUMAYUN:
will always be here, right in front of us, in our city.
---
## HUMAYUN:
So that at least is good…
---
## HUMAYUN:
We don’t  have to worry about something more beautiful being built anywhere else.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We get the most beautiful thing, right here in Agra.
---
template: noise
[Humayun groans with effort]
---
---
## BABUR:
Huma…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah?
---
## BABUR:
Do you understand what that means?
---
## HUMAYUN:
What *what* means?
---
## BABUR:
It means there will *never be anything as beautiful built ever again.*
---
## BABUR:
And if nothing so beautiful is ever built again,
---
## BABUR:
that means that beauty itself is dying.
---
## BABUR:
Right now, already, it’s dying.
---
## BABUR:
It means that one day, it will be gone altogether.
---
## BABUR:
And it’s my fault!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Come on, bhai…
---
## BABUR:
400 years, 500 years from now, Huma, maybe sooner,
---
## BABUR:
there won’t be any such thing as beauty.
---
## BABUR:
It was executed, and the executioner was me.
---
## BABUR:
I killed beauty.
---
## BABUR:
*I killed beauty…*
---
## BABUR: (emotionally)
*I killed beauty!*
---
## HUMAYUN:
No, you didn’t, you didn’t kill beauty!
---
## HUMAYUN:
You didn’t kill anything or anybody, you just did your job.
---
## BABUR:
Whether it was my job or not is besides the point!
---
## HUMAYUN:
It is exactly the point!
---
## HUMAYUN:
It is the only point!
---
## BABUR:
I killed beauty!
---
## HUMAYUN:
No, you didn’t, okay?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Nobody killed beauty, you can’t kill beauty.
---
## BABUR:
You just said it yourself!
---
## BABUR:
You just said, nothing more beautiful would ever be built again…
---
## BABUR:
That we get the most beautiful thing ever made here in Agra…
---
## BABUR:
but the flip side to that is that if nothing else will ever be built that is as beautiful,
---
## BABUR:
it means that beauty has actually gone extinct, and so….
---
## BABUR:
And so…that’s it.
---
## BABUR: (heartbroken)
It’s gone.
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
I guess you’re right.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Wow.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We killed beauty.
---
## BABUR:
NO.
---
## BABUR: (emotionally)
You didn’t kill beauty, *I* killed beauty.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We did this thing together!
---
## BABUR:
I chopped!
---
## BABUR:
You cauterized!
---
## HUMAYUN:
That’s semantics!
---
## BABUR:
I chopped, you cauterized—end of story.
---
## BABUR:
I did the damage.
---
## BABUR:
I removed the hands.
---
## BABUR:
I killed beauty.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You know what—you don’t ever give me credit for anything.
---
## BABUR:
I don’t ever!?
---
## BABUR:
Since when?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Take your pick!
---
## HUMAYUN:
My jokes aren’t funny, only your jokes are funny.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I’m not good at cards, only you’re good at cards.
---
## HUMAYUN:
My inventions are stupid, your inventions are interesting!
---
## BABUR:
I like the transportable hole!
---
## HUMAYUN:
It doesn’t work!
---
## HUMAYUN:
You can’t transport it!
---
## HUMAYUN:
And now I didn’t kill beauty, only you killed beauty,
---
## HUMAYUN:
even though I went fucking blind burning those bleeding stumps all night!
---
## HUMAYUN:
I think I should at least be an accessory to the crime!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Okay mister? Jeez.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s like I didn’t go through this whole ordeal with you tonight.
---
## BABUR:
It doesn’t feel like you did.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And why is that?
---
## BABUR:
You don’t care.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t care about what?
---
## BABUR:
You don’t care that twenty thousand men don’t have their hands anymore.
---
## HUMAYUN:
How am I supposed to care about that?
---
## HUMAYUN:
What is caring going to get me?
---
## BABUR:
It’s just the truth, Huma.
---
## HUMAYUN:
If we hadn’t done our jobs tonight,
---
## HUMAYUN:
we’d be hanging by our necks in the royal courtyard,
---
## HUMAYUN:
getting our eyes pecked out by the royal crows.
---
## HUMAYUN:
So excuse me if I don’t wallow in some misbegotten guilt all night.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Was it fucked up?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yes, it was.
---
## HUMAYUN:
But I don’t have to feel terrible about it.
---
## BABUR:
Yeah, you do.
---
## HUMAYUN:
No, I don’t.
---
## BABUR:
This is why you don’t get to say you killed beauty,
---
## BABUR:
why only *I* killed beauty,
---
## BABUR:
because you don’t even care.
---
## BABUR:
You don’t care about beauty.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I do, too, care about beauty.
---
## BABUR:
Fine, name one beautiful thing.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Taj Mahal.
---
## BABUR:
Name another.
---
## BABUR:
See you don’t know any—


## HUMAYUN:
—Give me a second!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Wine.

--
## BABUR:
Not beautiful, just tasty.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Women.
---
## BABUR:
Doesn’t count.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Women don’t count?

--
## BABUR:
No.
---
## HUMAYUN:
*Women don’t count as beautiful?*
---
## BABUR:
Different kind of beauty!
---
## HUMAYUN:
You’re all over the place!
---
## BABUR:
I like beauty.
---
## BABUR:
I have always liked beauty.
---
## BABUR:
It matters to me.
---
## BABUR:
It has never mattered to you.
---
## BABUR:
You’re only interested in rules.
---
## BABUR:
And the King. And your father. And being a good soldier.
--- 
## HUMAYUN:
Birds!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Birds are beautiful.

## HUMAYUN: (offstage)
Tell me *I* don’t like beauty…!

## HUMAYUN: (offstage)
I LOVE beauty…!

## HUMAYUN: (offstage)
I’m a beauty EXPERT.

## HUMAYUN:
What’s wrong, what are you doing?
---
## BABUR: (panicked)
Got blood on my face.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You’re *covered* in blood.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We both are.
---
## BABUR:
Won’t come off!

--
## HUMAYUN:
Babur…
---
## BABUR:
It won’t come off!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Babur! BABUR, STOP!

--
## HUMAYUN:
HEY!
---
## BABUR: (distraught)
It’s terrible what we did…

## HUMAYUN:
Hey.
---
## HUMAYUN:
…Hey, look at me.

I’ll wash your face, okay?

When we saw Taj Mahal…

I thought the moon had fallen.

I thought the moon had crashed in the river.

It’s prettier than the moon.

You’re here.

You’re on time.
---

## BABUR:
I had a terrible dream.
---
## HUMAYUN: (excitedly)
I have some good news!
---
## BABUR:
Worst nightmare of my life, bhai.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Do you want to tell me the dream first, or can I tell you the good news that I have?
---
## BABUR:
It was about aeroplats.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Okay, so your dream…
---
## BABUR:
They were so loud, they made a terrible sound.
---
## BABUR:
And there were hundreds of them.
---
## BABUR:
They were weapons…
---
## BABUR:
The aeroplats themselves were actually weapons, flying weapons, and…
---
## BABUR:
I mean, think about it, Huma…
---
## BABUR:
With aeroplats, you could defeat any army of men on elephants without a problem.
---
## BABUR:
But these were the aeroplats of a distant army.
---
## BABUR:
And they were coming for us.
---
## HUMAYUN:
For us?
---
## BABUR:
For Hindustan.
---
## BABUR:
And do you know how they would know when they found us?
---
## BABUR:
Guess.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t know.

--
## BABUR:
Guess.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t know, I don’t know how aeroplats work!
---
## BABUR:
Taj Mahal.
---
## BABUR:
They’ll see it, shining like the moon,
---
## BABUR:
and the first thing they’ll destroy is that.
---
## BABUR:
And so the Emperor stood above us.
---
## BABUR:
And he told us that there was a large piece of cloth.
---
## BABUR:
The biggest in the world.
---
## BABUR:
It was black…
---
## BABUR:
It was just like the transportable hole, Huma,
---
## BABUR:
and he told us if we could all grab a piece of this fabric and run with it,
---
## BABUR:
it would billow and lift, and we could drape it over Taj Mahal, and hide Taj Mahal.
---
## BABUR:
Hide it from the aeroplats.
---
## BABUR:
And so we ran to the cloth and we all tried to grab it, but we couldn’t.
---
## BABUR:
We couldn’t, Huma, because none of us had any hands.
---
## BABUR:
Even I didn’t.
---
## BABUR:
Neither did the Emperor.
---
## BABUR:
Everyone had lost their hands.
---
## BABUR:
And so we couldn’t grip the giant cloth,
---
## BABUR:
and then the aeroplats came and they destroyed Taj Mahal instantly,
---
## BABUR:
and the rest of Hindustan began to burn.
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
So...do you want to hear my good news?
---
## BABUR:
Sure.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You’re gonna like this.
---
## BABUR:
Okay.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I’m still in shock about it.
---
## BABUR:
Yeah?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Where do I begin?
---
## BABUR:
I don’t know.
---
## HUMAYUN:
So…

--
## BABUR:
Yeah?
---
## HUMAYUN:
I was speaking with my father.
---
## BABUR:
Yeah??
---
## HUMAYUN:
Because we carried out our duties last night with such…
---
## HUMAYUN:
efficiency…
---
## HUMAYUN:
And also because we cleaned up so well—
---
## HUMAYUN:
they were really impressed with how well we cleaned up—
---
## HUMAYUN:
my father has told me that you and I…
---
## HUMAYUN:
…are *assigned to the Imperial Harem*.
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
We’re on Harem duty.
---
## BABUR:
Harem duty?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Harem duty.
---
## BABUR:
We get to go into the Imperial Harem?!
---
## HUMAYUN:
See?
---
## HUMAYUN:
This is how it goes….
---
## HUMAYUN:
People notice.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Elders notice.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We did our job last night and we cleaned up so well—
---
## HUMAYUN:
they were really impressed with the clean-up job—
---
## HUMAYUN:
and now we get to accompany the Emperor himself to the Harem.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And guard him.
---
## HUMAYUN:
In the HAREM.
---
## BABUR:
That’s amazing!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Weren’t you just saying you wanted to see the inside of the Harem before you die?
---
## BABUR:
I was.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And here we go!
---
## BABUR:
Your father is the best.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It wasn’t because of my father!
---
## HUMAYUN:
It was because we carried out our duties so well!
---
## BABUR:
Sure yeah. I mean, that too.
---
## BABUR:
When?

--
## HUMAYUN:
Tomorrow.
---
## BABUR:
Tomorrow?!

--
## HUMAYUN:
No more dawn watch.
---
## BABUR:
Tomorrow!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Big blammo promotion, bhai.
---
## BABUR:
We’re on Harem duty.
---
## HUMAYUN:
No, we are *Personal Guards to the Emperor in the Imperial Harem.*
---
## HUMAYUN:
I love saying that.
---
## BABUR:
What do we do?
---
## BABUR:
How do we do it?
---
## BABUR:
Why do we do it?
---
## BABUR:
How does one *do* Harem Duty?
---
## HUMAYUN:
We accompany the Emperor from the palace to the Imperial Harem.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And then we follow him wherever he goes in the Harem.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And we stand at either side of him when he sits at the royal desk.
---
## BABUR:
Naked women every—
---
## HUMAYUN:
If there are naked women—which I highly doubt—
---
## HUMAYUN:
we can’t look or touch or even acknowledge them,
---
## HUMAYUN:
unless it is in service of the Emperor himself.
---
## BABUR:
Or what?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Or *what* what?
---
## BABUR:
Say I meet a nice girl in there and we—
---
## HUMAYUN:
You get executed. 
--
So don’t do that.
---
## BABUR:
The Imperial Harem!
---
## HUMAYUN:
You understand, this is unprecedented.
---
## BABUR:
Yeah!
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s a reward.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Everyone knew last night was a shit job.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And we did it and we did it well and we did not complain, so….
---
## HUMAYUN:
Harem duty.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You understand that, right?
---
## BABUR:
Yeah, sure, I do.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We do not always get pleasant tasks.
---
## BABUR:
Of course not.
---
## HUMAYUN:
But we work our way to the better tasks, the more pleasant tasks.
---
## BABUR:
Of course.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You understand how this works, right?
---
## BABUR:
Yes! I understand!
---
## BABUR:
Why do you keep asking me that?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Because sometimes I think you don’t understand.
---
## BABUR:
I get it!
---
## BABUR:
We do shit jobs first, and then we get better jobs,
---
## BABUR:
so long as we do the shit jobs well and without complaint.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Exactly.
---
## BABUR:
Not complicated.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Exactly.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You just seemed…
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
Last night…
---
## BABUR:
I seemed what?
---
## HUMAYUN:
You seemed….
---
## BABUR:
Like what?
---
## HUMAYUN:
You seemed like you didn’t understand that.
---
## BABUR:
I had a rough night.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Okay, well—*you’re not allowed to have a rough night, Mister.*
---
## BABUR:
I’m embarrassed, okay?
---
## BABUR:
I’m embarrassed by how I acted last night, Huma, I’m sorry.
---
## BABUR:
I didn’t mean to…
---
## BABUR:
I couldn’t stop…
---
## BABUR:
*You got to cauterize them!*
---
## HUMAYUN:
This again?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Chopping was not worse than cauterizing!
---
## BABUR:
It was different…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Let’s not fight about this.
---
## BABUR:
The point is…
---
## BABUR:
…The point is…
---
## BABUR:
There is no point.
---
## BABUR:
I’m sorry.
---
## BABUR: (emotionally)
I should have been stronger.
---
## HUMAYUN: (kindly)
You were strong.
---
## HUMAYUN: (kindly)
You are strong.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You’re here, this morning, at your post,
---
## HUMAYUN:
on time for the first time in your life.
---
## HUMAYUN:
After nightmares, and after last night.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You’re strong, Babur.
---
## HUMAYUN:
The point is, you need to stop thinking about it and you need to stop talking about it.
---
## BABUR:
Stop thinking.
---
## BABUR:
Stop talking.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You’re lucky we’re old friends, old pals.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Some other bastard would’ve already pegged you for a traitor or a bitch, and then what?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Words spread out across the guard, and *pop*!
---
## HUMAYUN:
You have a traitorous bitch of a reputation, and that’s not good.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Reputations stain deeper than blood.
---
## BABUR:
You didn’t tell anyone….?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Of course I didn’t.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You’re my bhai.
---
## HUMAYUN:
But stop thinking about it and stop talking about it,
---
## HUMAYUN:
and let’s just enjoy our good fortune here, Babu…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Imperial Harem.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You and me.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Standing guard, right next to the Emperor.
---
## BABUR:
Right next to him.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Maybe a little behind, just a shred.
---
## HUMAYUN:
So we don’t impede his vision, et cetera.
---
## BABUR:
Just a little behind…

## BABUR:
You and me.

--
## HUMAYUN:
Me and you.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Standing proud, regal as the man himself.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Protecting him.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Daring some piss-shit fellow to come at him with ill intentions.
---

[They start to imitate sword-fighting sounds]
---
## HUMAYUN:
Done.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Bingo-bango, sent to the grave, quick-stuffed!
---
## BABUR: (in exaggerated unison)
*Yeah!*


## HUMAYUN: (in exaggerated unison)
*Yeah*.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It takes years to make these strides.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Years.
---
## HUMAYUN:
But a job like last night’s doesn’t come along that often.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We have an honest battle story, bhai.
---
## HUMAYUN:
From now until we’re old and grey,
---
## HUMAYUN:
we’ll be telling our sons and grandsons about The Night of the Forty Thousand Hands.
---
## BABUR:
I thought we were supposed to stop thinking, stop talking…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Stop thinking, stop talking *like you are*.
---
## BABUR:
Like me…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah, like how you are thinking and talking with this air of regret.
---
## BABUR:
*Regret*.

--
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah. *Regret*.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I’m saying, *brag about it*.
---
## BABUR: (sadly)
You’re right.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Right?
---
## BABUR:
Absolutely.
---
## BABUR:
Brag.
---
## BABUR:
*I cut off forty thousand hands!* *Ho!*
---
## HUMAYUN:
Imperial Harem, bhai.
---
## BABUR:
Standing right next to the Emperor.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Or a shred behind him so as to not impede his view.
---
## BABUR:
Standing a shred behind him.
---
## BABUR:
Guarding him.
---
## BABUR:
Guarding Shah Jahan.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Proud as cocks.
---
## BABUR:
I won’t be late.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You better not be late.
---
## BABUR:
Women everywhere in the Harem.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And eunuchs.
---
## BABUR:
Those poor bastards.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And the King.
---
## BABUR:
And Us.
---
## BABUR:
Standing just a little bit behind him.
---
## BABUR:
Just a shred behind…
---
## BABUR:
…the Emperor.
---
## BABUR:
Right behind him.
---
## BABUR:
Him, sitting right there.
---
## BABUR:
At the royal desk.
---
## BABUR:
Me, just a little behind…
---
## BABUR:
A shred behind him.
---
## BABUR:
…*A shred behind him…*
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Why are you saying it like that?
---
## BABUR: (slowly)
Humayun!
---
## HUMAYUN:
What?
---
## BABUR:
I have an idea.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Okay.
---
## BABUR:
Hear me out.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Okay.
---
## BABUR:
You probably won’t like it at first.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Just tell me.
---
## BABUR:
But if you just give it a second…
---
## HUMAYUN:
An invention?
---
## BABUR:
No. 
--
Yes. 
--
Maybe.
---
## BABUR:
A little bit of that.
---
## BABUR:
So…
--
we’re at the Imperial Harem tomorrow.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah.
---
## BABUR:
And we’re standing just a shred behind the Emperor at the royal desk.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Just a shred behind him.
---
## BABUR:
And so…at one point, when maybe nobody else is in the room…
---
## BABUR:
we’ll make a secret signal to each other.
---
## HUMAYUN:
What kind of secret signal?
---
## BABUR:
Something really subtle.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We can’t move, though.
---
## BABUR:
We’ll figure something out.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Why are we making the secret signal?
---
## BABUR:
I’m getting to that…

--
## HUMAYUN:
Okay.
---
## BABUR:
When we do make the secret signal,
---
## BABUR:
you grab the Emperor’s head, 
--
pull it back,
---
## BABUR:
and then I’ll slice his neck wide fucking open.
---
---
## HUMAYUN:
Wait…say again?
---
## BABUR:
Let’s kill the King.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Whoa…
--
WHAT!?
---
## HUMAYUN:
What the hell are you talking about?
---
## HUMAYUN:
*What did you just say!?*
---
## BABUR:
You said you were gonna hear me out.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You can’t say that, 
--
and you can’t mean that, 
--
and and and…
---
## HUMAYUN:
LOOK. I’m going to let you shut your treasonous face and take up your position,
---
## HUMAYUN:
and we’ll never speak of it again.
---
## BABUR:
I didn’t realize it until just now, but this is the only thing to do.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Please…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Don’t go crazy.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Don’t go crazy on me, Babur…
---
## BABUR:
Not crazy.
---
## BABUR:
Listen.
---
## BABUR:
First of all, I killed beauty.
---
## HUMAYUN:
*You didn’t kill beauty!*
---
## BABUR:
Okay, we killed  beauty.
---
## BABUR:
*We* did, okay?
---
## HUMAYUN:
No, shut up, okay!
---
## HUMAYUN:
It is fine to have a philosophical conversation about aesthetics,
---
## HUMAYUN:
but you just threatened to *kill the King!*
---
## BABUR:
Yeah, I’m gonna do that.
---
## BABUR:
We should do it together.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Babur, please, stop!
---
## HUMAYUN:
They can kill you just for saying that!
---
## HUMAYUN:
You’re out of your mind!

--
## BABUR:
Nope.
---
## BABUR:
Thinking clearly here, bhai.
---
## BABUR:
Have a good sense of things here, bhai…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Oh, very clearly.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We chop off the Emperor’s head tomorrow morning…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Then what!?
---
## BABUR:
Well, that’s the rest of the plan.
---
## BABUR:
We exit the office, calmly, walking through the halls of the harem.
---
## BABUR:
Nobody will speak to us.
---
## BABUR:
We leave the harem, we go to the royal stables, we take two horses,
---
## BABUR:
and then we ride out to the jungle.
---
## HUMAYUN:
That’s your plan!?
---
## BABUR:
Remember our sandalwood raft in the trees?
---
## BABUR:
We stayed three nights in the jungle!
---
## BABUR:
This time, we’ll make a better one, a bigger one, with a roof, and near some water,
---
## BABUR:
and we can hunt animals and eat them,
---
## BABUR:
and we could live just you and me, Huma, out in the wild…
---
## BABUR:
…away from everything, away from the world.
---
## BABUR:
Away from the King and your father and the rules,
---
## BABUR:
and far away from the memory of what we did.
---
## BABUR:
Nobody will ever make us do anything again.
---
## BABUR:
Wouldn’t that be good?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Why can’t we do that without killing the King?
---
## BABUR:
I mean, we could…
---
## BABUR:
but killing the King…
---
## BABUR:
that’s the main part.
---
## BABUR:
*We kill him, so beauty can live.*
---
## HUMAYUN:
You’re crazy.
---
## BABUR:
Tell me you wouldn’t want to live out in the jungle away from the world!
---
## HUMAYUN:
I wouldn’t!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Okay?
---
## HUMAYUN:
That sounds awful!
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t want to have to hunt for my food,
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t want to sleep outside every night,
---
## HUMAYUN:
and I certainly don’t want to risk my neck murdering the Emperor!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Babur! Wake up!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Because I don’t think you actually understand *anything*.
---
## HUMAYUN:
There is the King.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And he is at the center.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And there are those who serve him, closely, like us,
---
## HUMAYUN:
and so we are near the center, and so our lives are good and we eat well.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And then there’s the rest of the world out there, balancing on the edge of things.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And they do not eat well.
---
## HUMAYUN:
But yesterday…
---
## HUMAYUN:
and today…
---
## HUMAYUN:
If people see Taj Mahal and suddenly think that this wonderful, unbelievable thing
---
## HUMAYUN:
was created by 20,000 ordinary men,
---
## HUMAYUN:
then they begin to wonder about changing their lives.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And if enough people do that, then the edge might come for the center.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And the center could be cast away.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And then we’re fucked.
---
## HUMAYUN:
So that’s why we did this.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Your sword, my cauterizing iron, those baskets of hands…
---
## HUMAYUN:
This is called keeping the peace.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We have a good life, Babu.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And I appreciate it.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I like the world.
---
## BABUR:
You like the world?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah.
---
## BABUR:
*This* world, you’re saying.
---
## BABUR:
You like *this* world…?
---
## BABUR: (emotionally)
Where we have to behand 20,000 men in one night?
---
## BABUR: (emotionally)
Where we have to kill off beauty like a wounded animal?
---
## BABUR: (emotionally)
Where anything we might ever feel or think or say
---
## BABUR: (emotionally)
could cause us to be executed simply because 
--
the Emperor is shithouse crazy?
---
## HUMAYUN:
There is either allegiance to the Emperor, or there is death.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I’m choosing Not Death.
---
## HUMAYUN:
So should you.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I’m sorry you can’t handle the sight of a couple gallons of blood,
---
## HUMAYUN:
but grow some balls, *yaar*, seriously.
---
## BABUR:
If you don’t want to help me tomorrow, that’s fine, but I am going to kill the King.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You think you can kill the King?
---
## HUMAYUN:
I’ll be right on his other side, bhai.
---
## HUMAYUN:
And as my oaths dictate,
---
## HUMAYUN:
any man who raises a hand to His Most Glorious Emperor Shah Jahan
---
## HUMAYUN:
will pay for it with his *life*.
---
## HUMAYUN:
You want me to kill you tomorrow morning?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Is that what you want?
---
## BABUR:
I don’t want Taj Mahal to be the last beautiful thing ever made.
---
## HUMAYUN:
If the King decrees that beauty is dead, then beauty is dead.
---
## BABUR:
Then fuck the King.
---
## BABUR:
Beauty shall live.
---
## BABUR:
Fuck the King!
---
## BABUR:
Beauty shall live!
---
## BABUR: (louder)
FUCK THE KING!
---
## BABUR: (louder)
BEAUTY SHALL LIVE!
---
## BABUR: (at top of his lungs)
FUCK THE KING!
---
## BABUR: (muffled screaming)
BEAUTY SHALL LIVE!
---
## HUMAYUN:
You are under arrest for…
---
## HUMAYUN:
…for…
---
## HUMAYUN:
you are arrested for *blasphemy*!
---
## HUMAYUN:
BLASPHEMY!
---
## BABUR:
What are you talking about?
---
## HUMAYUN: (quietly)
Listen, bhai…
---
## HUMAYUN: (quietly)
it’s just blasphemy.
---
## HUMAYUN: (quietly)
Three days in jail.
---
## HUMAYUN: (quietly)
That’s it.
---
## HUMAYUN: (quietly)
You go to jail, you cool your head, you stop this crazy talk.
---
## BABUR:
Get OFF—stop, Humaaaaah!
---
## HUMAYUN:
If they hear what you’re saying, they will have an elephant *trample you to death*!
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s treason, bhai!
---
## BABUR:
Let me go…
---
## BABUR: (choking)
Damnit, Humayun!
---
## HUMAYUN: (quietly)
You’ll do three days and then you’ll come out and it’ll be just me and you.
---
## HUMAYUN: (quietly)
You and me.
---
## HUMAYUN: (quietly)
Okay?
---
## HUMAYUN: (quietly)
Okay…
---
## HUMAYUN: (quietly)
…Okay.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Guards!

## HUMAYUN:
…Guards!

GUARDS!

I should have never opened my mouth around you,

Oh son of the big boss on high.

You really thought I would have gone along with it?

You thought me, Babur, was going to kill the Emperor?!

I just needed to talk through it, was all, Huma.
---
## BABUR:
God, you overreact.

## HUMAYUN:
*I* overreact!?

They would have put you to death for what you said!

So now I’m in jail.

## BABUR:
Charged with blasphemy.
---
## BABUR:
Is that what happened?
---
## HUMAYUN:
You wouldn’t shut up!

## BABUR:
When have I ever shut up?

## BABUR:
What day since we were boys did I not blabber to you about this or that,
---
## BABUR:
about fancies and prophecies and inventions or what dreams I had…
---
## BABUR:
But now, today, out of the blue, you arrest me?
---
## HUMAYUN:
You never before plotted to murder the King.
---
## BABUR:
I wouldn’t have done it.
---
## BABUR:
I couldn’t.
---
## BABUR:
I don’t know if I can stand the sight of blood anymore.

Some guard you would make, then.

You’re weak.

I could never bear to hurt anyone.

You know this.

## BABUR:
I apologize to a chicken before I snap his neck.

## BABUR:
I’m weak.

## BABUR:
I like being weak.

That doesn’t make any sense.

Who knows?

Nobody wants to be weak.

Nobody prefers to be weak.

I appreciate what you did.

What?

Arresting me.

You probably saved my life.

You can’t take my hands.

Huma, it’s me, it’s Babur, okay?

You can’t chop off your bhai’s hands!

I thought blasphemy would be the best charge…

## HUMAYUN:
Three days in jail.
---
## BABUR:
Yeah! That’s what you said!

## HUMAYUN:
I had to invent some story, so I did,

## HUMAYUN:
and I told the mansabdar my tall tale,

## HUMAYUN:
and he believed it just fine…

## HUMAYUN:
but then I had to go before my father…

## HUMAYUN:
And he knew I was lying.

## HUMAYUN:
He looks through me.

## HUMAYUN:
He can read my mind…

And so I told him…

## HUMAYUN:
Everything about you, about what you said, and then I…

Babu…

I threw myself at his feet and begged him to not kill you.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I cried and I begged…

## HUMAYUN:
He was disgusted in me.

## HUMAYUN:
But he said you could live.

## HUMAYUN:
But only if…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Only if I take your hands.
---
## BABUR:
No! No! No!
---
## HUMAYUN:
I have to do it.

## BABUR:
Listen, Huma, you don’t have to.

## BABUR:
There’s nothing you have to do.

## BABUR:
You’re smart, you can figure something out.
---
## BABUR:
Just let me go.
---
## BABUR:
Say I escaped.
---
## BABUR:
I’ll run off.
---
## BABUR:
Nobody will ever hear from me again…

## BABUR:
*Just don’t take my hands…*

## HUMAYUN:
If I don’t, they’ll kill you.

## BABUR:
No, they won’t.

They won’t!

I’ll escape!

We’re really going to spend the night on this *thing*?
---
## HUMAYUN:
In a *tree*?
---
## HUMAYUN:
In the *jungle*?
---
## BABUR:
It’s sandalwood.
---
## BABUR:
It has this smell…
---
## BABUR:
Mosquitos won’t come near…
---
## BABUR:
and neither will snakes….
---
## BABUR:
The smell is distinct.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I do love that smell.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Look at this platform!
---
## HUMAYUN:
It is pretty good.
---
## HUMAYUN:
We *made* this.
---
## HUMAYUN:
…We *made* this with our *swords*.
---
## BABUR:
It’s probably the greatest thing I’ve ever made.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Really?
---
## BABUR:
Yeah.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t know about that.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I once carved a piece of wood to look like a bird.
---
## HUMAYUN:
It looked just like a bird.
---
## HUMAYUN:
That was probably the best thing I’ve ever made.
---
## HUMAYUN:
This is second.
---
## BABUR:
You carve wood into birds?
---
## HUMAYUN:
I used to.
---
## HUMAYUN:
Not so much anymore.
---
## HUMAYUN:
My dad thinks it’s wasteful of my time.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I dunno.

[they laugh]
---
## BABUR:
Wouldn’t you rather be lost forever?
---
## BABUR:
Wouldn’t that be so much better than going back to the troop
---
## BABUR:
and the army and Agra and everything?
---
## BABUR:
Living out here?
---
## BABUR:
Away from everyone.
---
## HUMAYUN:
I don’t want to be lost forever!
---
## BABUR:
It might be more interesting, is all I’m saying.

## BABUR:
Hey, Humayun…
---
## BABUR:
Look!
---
## HUMAYUN:
What?
---
## BABUR:
Through these branches…
---
## BABUR:
Look at that…!
---
## BABUR:
I can’t believe I didn’t see that…!
---
## BABUR:
What *is* that?!
---
## HUMAYUN:
Oh whoa…
---
## HUMAYUN:
WOW.
---
## BABUR:
What is that, a lake?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah, it’s a…
---
## HUMAYUN:
…pink lake?
---
## BABUR:
No, there’s gotta be something on it.
---
## BABUR:
What the hell is it?
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s moving…
---
## BABUR:
Yeah, what is it…
---
## BABUR:
It’s something on the water…
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s birds!
---
## BABUR: (incredulous)
Birds?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah, they’re birds, sitting on the water…
---
## BABUR:
The entire thing is birds…?
---
## BABUR: (so excited)
That entire lake, every inch, is covered by a bird…?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Yeah…a pink and purple bird.
---
## BABUR:
And green too?
---
## BABUR:
Or is that the water…?
---
## HUMAYUN:
Pink, purple, and green birds…
---
## HUMAYUN:
Look—how beautiful, huh?
---
## BABUR:
There must be millions of them.
---
## HUMAYUN:
At least.
---
## HUMAYUN:
What kind of bird is that…?
---
## HUMAYUN:
It’s…uhmmm…
---
## HUMAYUN:
…chiff-chaff?
---
## HUMAYUN:
…Or maybe it’s a…
